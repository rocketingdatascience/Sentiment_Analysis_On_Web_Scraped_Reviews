EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Really more fun than I thought it would be as I'm not normally a fan of 'survival' games. But there are lots of ways to play this thing. Set up a private server and rock and roll!;Recommended;143;30.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has a lot of potential and fun features to offer. However, I am worried that it might never leave the early access stage - just like craftopia - and become another unfinished sandbox survival game. I hope I am mistaken about this.;Not Recommended;197;6.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;i love this game but as of right now (feb 4th, 2024) there is a bug glitch that when u raise your effigy to have a higher catch rate, it actually lowers your catch rate. Devs please fix this asap THANKS love the game otherwise;Recommended;182;96.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A good mix if light survival, reasonable base building, the magic of Pokemon, and the ability to us them like they do in the Flintstones. A delightful experience.That being said, this is early access and filled to the brim with bugs. Falling through the world, frequent server crashes, etc.... Play with this in mind and get it cheap now, or wait until it is fixed and likely at full release prices.;Recommended;329;100.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;uncommon creature game w;Recommended;21;178.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;One of the best farming management simulators I've played. The livestock breeding system is very in-depth, and the addition of having to defend your farm from wild animals or even raiders is pretty unique to the genre. 10/10 would breed livestock again.;Recommended;212;132.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Not bad for an Alpha LOL.Exploits, bugs, cheaters, spontanious server wipes, is what you get... but if you rent your own dedicated server and inivite your buddys your fine i guess... justs it costs more money ofc. I guess for an Alpha game at the price of only 28 Euros not bad nowadays.Come back in a year if the game is not dead by then its maybe worth playing mplayer... I tried and spent alot of time but Char got wiped after i hit lvl 42. Very sad indeed. O before that my base got wiped 3 times but i kept my char lvls at least untill today.;Not Recommended;440;136.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;i totally love this game;Recommended;20;50.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Pokemon with Guns... but SO much more!I find it to be a lovely blend between the Catch-mon genre and survival games, similar to Ark, etc.There is SO much to do, even within the early access period.The build crafting is pretty great (despite some lil annoyances that I'm sure will be patched out later)The combat with Pals is satisfying, and the map is massive! So much to explore, and this is just the beginning.The freedom that this game allows you is SUCH a breath of fresh air to these types of games.If you like games like Pokemon for catching creatures, and you're in to building like in Minecraft, this is a hit for you. :D;Recommended;516;131.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game really made me fall back in love with gaming.Only in early access and I'm gonna be playing for the long haul.you think you've only played 1 hour but it's actually been 6.100% Recommend;Recommended;160;63.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I don't really care to compare this game to another. So that's not what I'll do here. I'm going to give my take on it as is it.For an early access title, it is not without numerous bugs/glitches and the like. That's to be expected. The gameplay at the core has been quite satisfying. Everything from catching Pals, fighting bosses, building a base and getting them up and running somewhat efficient'y; it all never fails to keep my attention for an extended period of time. The breeding mechanic especially gives me those doses of dopamine when I open eggs to see whats inside.Exploration has been quite an adventure too, the over world is littered with mobs of Pals, and some aggressive humanoids, there is even some field bosses that you might run into when you're ill prepared.Overall what makes this experience the best for me is the ability to play with my significant other, on our own realm without the intrusion of others. We have had an absolute blast spending hours roaming, crafting, and gathering together.I can not wait to see where this game heads into the future. It'll be fantastic I'm sure.";Recommended;915;47.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;prook for the price and i realy mean ok just okconsgeneral assets does not match the art style of the poke cough cough palsai inside the base is total garbage they get lost they get stuck i come back a couple hours later and they are tired hungry i come back a day later they are depressed ulcers starving to the point were they zero on food so then if im away for some time i have to make sure i have meds every time i log back in oh and god dont make a base that has any sort of height difference because the ai will defo get lost and never figure out how to path to something and when you get them to do a job they will change and do something else for example i have tried to set x pals to power up the base they get bored then start chopping wood and thats even when there is zero powerbattle ai jesus it is one of the most clunky stuff i have seen in years they get stuck everywere and on everything more so when the pals are biggerthe stats are useless if you like to do a bit of both base so on i have all my stats set on managing how much i can carry and i mean all my stats and i have issues alot with it yes the graple gun can help with that but its just a pain in the backside since the graple gun can act realy funky then you just end up floating in the airalot of the good base locations can not be used because the raiders or bandits or whatever you want to call them have a base set up therehonestly when you want to auto farm stuff with your palls you have to manage the pals often moving them picking them up putting them back in the base then removing them so on to ensure the ai does not get stuck then you end up with them being realy angry upset so on so for a game thats realy supposed to be automated for a base is not realy automated unless you want to pretty much be a doctor and a baby sitterthe base building is garbothe interactions is even more garbo you try and select something and depending on were you are looking and i mean the char model not your crosshair you can be interacting with something that is on your left right middle top it is truly the worst interaction system dont put chest close to each other otherwise you will be sitting there for hours trying to interact with the chest you want and lets not forget when you try and interact with lets say a workbench if you have a wall behind it then a bed or another type of work bench you might end up ignoring the workbench in front of you and interacting with the ones behind the wallgeneral thoughts it can be fun to play with friends in this game but like most games these days it can get damn boring fast mods will make this game way more interesting and maybe could fix alot of the ai issues should you get it because of the price i have less of an expectation on this game some of the mechanics are nice the skills of pals can get repetitive fast like no joke its an ok game with friends it can be fun mod the hell out of it though thats the one thing that will make the life cycle of this game to extend i honestly wish steam had an option for do you recommend this game were instead of a thumbs up or down it just has two hands out to say meh like you are unsure coz on one hand its good but there are so many factors that make realy annoying to play i cant say this enough get mods make mods whatever the case do something with the game to give yourself something else to do than the same repetitive ♥♥♥♥ you have to do everytime you log in i saw on ututbe gura has a mod were she has dino gura that could at least be usefull for a giggle or two i heard its a small team with no experiance at all in unreal so on that respect well done is this a game that everyone is hyping it up to be no? NO ! JUST NO!!! default with no mods should you buy honestly no with mods yeah it could be fun;Not Recommended;3015;104.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;If you like Ark but not fond of Studio Wildcard you'll probably enjoy this.As of Early Access it plays close to that with some features missing while other features have been streamlined, and per their roadmap things like pvp that are missing are planned to be added back.Do your own research on the game though. It's suffering from a weird effect of so many people looking at it where it seems like if someone is hyping it or nagging it, everyone always seems to get something about it wrong.;Recommended;405;44.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Its an early access game rn (2-4-2024). Its fun and repetitive but you WILL find something else to hyper focus on. It will either be building your base, catching pals, or just exploring the world.;Recommended;162;54.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;After 105 hours played and completing all the towers I can comfortably say this is the best early access game I've ever played and it puts most AAA full release offerings to shame.If they manage to squash the bugs, polish the AI and flesh out the endgame a bit more this is likely game of the year for me and it's barely February.;Recommended;268;105.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Did you guys know Nintendo ripped off palworld? Catching creatures in balls, types, even the style itself! That's crazy!;Recommended;102;262.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is fine. IT has the same issues a lot of survival games have where you just end up hitting a spot where one particular resource brings your progression to an extremely abrupt halt. Its ore. It's always ore in these types of games.I was putting a lot of time daily into this for a few weeks but then just...stopped. I don't want to get on to grind ore so I can make red balls to actually catch stuff. My friend doesn't want to change his server settings to make it easier and I understand that but man, ♥♥♥♥ is painfully slow when you get near level 30. I don't think I want to see what's after level 30...But I got 30 hours of gameplay and may get more in the future so $30 is a good deal;Recommended;556;27.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is fine. IT has the same issues a lot of survival games have where you just end up hitting a spot where one particular resource brings your progression to an extremely abrupt halt. Its ore. It's always ore in these types of games.I was putting a lot of time daily into this for a few weeks but then just...stopped. I don't want to get on to grind ore so I can make red balls to actually catch stuff. My friend doesn't want to change his server settings to make it easier and I understand that but man, ♥♥♥♥ is painfully slow when you get near level 30. I don't think I want to see what's after level 30...But I got 30 hours of gameplay and may get more in the future so $30 is a good deal;Recommended;556;27.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is basically a reskin of ARK: Survival Evolved / Survival Ascended. And just like ARK is/was an unprofessional mess of frustrating server crashes, bugs, and poorly thought out game play, this game is, too. The building mechanics are clumsy and clunky. Can't attach ceilings to foundations, can't replace wood foundations with stone, etc. Pals evade and starve because of bad pathing and getting stuck in random places in base.I've gotten early mid game and can't figure out what the game-play loop is beyond tame stuff to breed stuff--which would be fine, if either system was satisfying, but it's not.I'd probably be more tolerant of this game if I'd never played ARK, but alas I have.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Hell yeah, really good fun. Probably best to play it solo though.;Recommended;54;93.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I am the ultimate pal enslaver and recommend this for all;Recommended;47;76.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Good pacing in the leveling system and large world to explore. Other enhancement systems like the Anubis statue and pal condenser also add a fun grind to catching duplicates.;Recommended;146;33.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun game. Ark style gameplay mixed with Pets that can help you in more ways than one. You can rush to 50 or take your time and enjoy the game and both ways of playing are rewarding. Look forward to the initial road map and any editions this game might bring.;Recommended;208;74.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I found a dinosaur wearing a hoodie and a living improvised explosive.I've spent a collective 30 hours punching pals, now I hurl arrows at them on the back of a wolf like Neytiri on meth.;Recommended;153;58.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;My new favorite game!I've been a lifelong Pokemon fan. I played all the games, i bought cards, i collected the show, i played hundreds of hours collecting almost every pokemon there was. But pokemon scarlet was my final straw and i finally quit.As a kid pokemon made me feel like an adult. It didn't care that I was 10 years old, it sent me off on a worldwide adventure battling with monsters and fighting gangs and changing the world.As an adult pokemon made me feel like a kid. It didn't care that I was in my 20's, It put me in a school uniform, put me back in elementary school and made game-play for small children.Palworld did everything pokemon wouldn't do, it brought the game-play into the modern era, it made beautiful graphics and it treated the original adult pokemon community with respect. Until pokemon does the same, i'm only playing palworld.10/10;Recommended;713;9.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Hold on to your hats, folks, and let's dive into the wonderfully wacky world of Palworld – where survival of the fittest meets a bizarre pet simulator, and the only thing more abundant than the fun is the utter madness!First off, let's talk survival. In Palworld, you're not just battling the elements; you're up against your own moral compass. Food's scarce, and sometimes, your fluffy friend might just become dinner. I mean, who knew ethical dilemmas could be so appetizing?Mounts and exploration? Oh, it's a blast! Whether you're riding a fish through the ocean or a bird through the sky, traversing the land feels like being in a fantastical Uber service. Just don't forget to tip your Pal with some extra snacks!Building structures is where your inner pyramid scheme dream comes alive. You can literally have an army of Pals building your fantasy castle. Forget labor laws; it's all about paw and claw labor here. Who needs a construction permit when you've got a bear with a hard hat?Now, let's talk about the production aspect. It's like having your own army of fluffy electricians and miners, minus the union dues. Watching a rabbit generate electricity by running on a wheel? Priceless.Farming is a hoot with your team of agricultural Pals. It’s like having your own crew of mini farmers, only cuter and with more fur. Forget tractors – here, a plowing field is just a giant hamster wheel away.Factories and automation in Palworld are all about exploiting...I mean, utilizing your Pals' talents. It's like watching a bizarre version of ""How It's Made,"" except with more paws and less humans.Dungeon exploration is no less thrilling. It's like going on a treasure hunt with your pets, if your pets were also your bodyguards and sometimes, well, your sacrificial lambs. Oops!Breeding & genetics – think of it as a bizarre dating app for Pals. Swipe right on a strong Pal, and you might just breed the Schwarzenegger of the Pal world!Poaching & crime add a sprinkle of moral ambiguity to the mix. Remember kids, it's not illegal if you're not caught! Channel your inner sneaky raccoon and capture those rare Pals. Wildlife sanctuaries? More like freebie shops!And finally, multiplayer – because everything's better with friends, especially when it involves trading and battling Pals. It's like Pokémon, but with a chance of your friend eating their pet out of desperation.With co-op play and the promise of PvP in future updates, Palworld is not just a game; it's a rollercoaster of emotions, questionable life choices, and endless hilarity. So, grab a Pal, hold on tight, and enjoy the chaos. It's a world where being a crazy cat lady has nothing on being a Pal hoarder. 10/10, would eat a Pal again!";Recommended;2253;1.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've only played 19 hours of this game at this point, but man is it fun. Every time I load up the game, I wind up playing for way longer than I intend to.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;pokemon;Recommended;7;86.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Amazing game, myriad of issues due to being incredibly early access. It makes me wanna doubt that claim of being 60% done.It also has crashing problems on Steam Deck, well, different problems. In desktop mode, it won't let you get past the menu without self destructing, and in handheld mode after playing long enough, it'll lock up the entire deck until force restarting.It's a fun amazing game, I've barely gone that far but still have had tons of fun.;Recommended;376;13.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I am going to give my honest opinion in between all this hype.Sure, this game is pretty much Pokemon meets ARK (I wouldnt say ark... id use a different game), it does have some amazing and terrible sides.Lets start with the prosThe game looks and feels alive and part of the experience is traversing the world looking for those elusive pals you dont have and even when you have them all, the feeling of trying to breed the perfect workhorses or combat pals is very fun. The crafting and building is simple enough to understand and provides good enjoyment for the survivalist. the gym battles are very fun along with the world bosses and provide good alternative to spice up your combat. Its really nice automating your base and having things move forward while you continue exploring.Now... for the negative side. Hopefully most of these get fixed with updates since this game is early access.while the world is nice to explore and all, large chunks of it feel lifeless, with soooo much unused space. They are decorated, but they dont feel as alive. Some sections of the map are terribly optimised (Talking about you bamboo forest), it suddenly lags me down a lot... beautiful area to build, but the lag is intense for me, even on single player. Pals have big pathing problems, with them getting stuck often while moving around your base, added to that, the Pal base perimeter is too small to utilise all the crafting buildings. I thought of building a multistory base to fix this problem, but Pals dont climb stairs for some reason (Also sucks if your defenses are on the second floor)... You are forced to split the workforce between multiple bases to do everything. They should allow us to prioritise the work. (For example. A fire type should focus on staying at the forge and not leave it to gather dropped materials)Pal condensation feels like a pretty high feeding curve... i mean from 4 pals required to 16 is a big jump. especially when working with rarer pals, who are hard to find. Pals should be able to get food directly from the fridge....And lastly, tech points need to be improved. Its hard for people to play solo since you dont get enough tech points to actually learn everything. a good way to change it would be to allow use to unlock pal unique items for free. The cities could do with some more life injected into them. The desert city had less people than the small settlement. The dungeons could do with a map (Of what you explored)... it is not fun once you have gotten lost...I have a lot of small gripes Listed above and some more i did not list. They have NOT stopped me from enjoying this game and i really would still recommend it to everyone. I will update periodically if these issues above get fixed;Recommended;2245;34.9;

Its hard for people to play solo since you dont get enough tech points to actually learn everything. a good way to change it would be to allow use to unlock pal unique items for free. The cities could do with some more life injected into them. The desert city had less people than the small settlement. The dungeons could do with a map (Of what you explored)... it is not fun once you have gotten lost...I have a lot of small gripes Listed above and some more i did not list. They have NOT stopped me from enjoying this game and i really would still recommend it to everyone. I will update periodically if these issues above get fixed;Recommended;2245;34.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is basically Ark Survival meets Pokemon. There are very good things that improve upon both games. I like that you can customize the map. I love catching all the creatures! The building is much easier than in Ark which is great. Its not just grinding like Pokemon. There are many things to do and I am sure I don't even know everything this game has to offer yet. Only downside is I keep getting some screen error that wont go away and I have to restart. A few bugs but nothing game breaking. On Xbox I can't even play right now because it's bugs. I haven't played a game like this in a long time.;Recommended;486;6.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's an enjoyable survival game, it plays like Ark does but has traversal, sound, and location UI like the legend of zelda games, ToTK and BoTW, the automation building is fun and exploring is cool.

I enjoy the fact that if I'm not paying attention I'll literally get lost. Any game that can make me feel like I've legit gotten lost in the landscape is a good open world game. A lot of people are saying its like Pokemon with guns, but I say that's an insult to Palworld. Its better. Pokemon has spent too much time focused on quantity over quality and it shows with the last several games. Yet this game, with only a fraction of the people working on it, have managed to improve on many of the things that people claim to like about pokemon. And is 20x more fun.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Very good game, I like how it twists up the formula. It's more fun than just pokemon with guns, because their target audience isnt kids. Because of that this game does things Pokemon could never do. Also now that Nintendo has competitoin for once mayble they'll make a good game again. Most of the people that play this game are fans of pokemon, sure some of the monsters look the same, but the game is actually good.;Recommended;341;90.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;So, I did see people giving this game criticism among other criticism for seemingly having animal cruelty or slavery as a concept in this game. After playing this game I disagree with those criticisms. Yes, you can use your pals for labor but would this have been an issue if these were humans instead of pokemon-like animals? Games in the real time strategy genre let players essentially command humans to do similar tasks but often we just assume if that were the real world these people would be compensated and fill the gap in our own mind even though the games may not explicitly show this. You in fact are compensating the Pals by giving them food, shelter, and a purpose other than survival.Palworld similar to an animal caring type game encourages you to take good care of your pals. If you neglect them they can get sick, starve, and the end result is they become less productive as a function your base of operations. You do have the freedom to do bad things just as you might in any other sandbox open-world game but doing those bad things isn't necessarily prioritized or beneficial and at the end of the day this is just a video game.If these kinds of things hold you back from buying the game then I just want to say you can put aside those concerns.Palworld does have bugs and minor annoyances you might expect from an early access game but comparatively to other early access games (I've played many) Palworld comes out fairly well. Nothing is super game breaking and can almost always be worked around and who knows what might happen with future patches. I think Palworld has a bright future as long as the developers stay on their current trajectory and don't make any foolish decisions.;Recommended;1403;139.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;satisfying;Recommended;10;32.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A great game, tons of fun ! I hope Pokemon make a survival game like this one.;Recommended;62;19.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've only gotten to about Level 27 in my play through, however, I will say I have had a lot of fun doing so.The base level up and work system are really cool, and there are a lot of options given the large variety of pals to choose from.The combat is a lot of fun, though, the boss fights can feel pretty repetitive after a while and not very dynamic. I love the dodging mechanic though.The raid system is pretty good as well. It keeps you on your toes and ensures that there is always action. However, the raid enemies will not attack you until they actually get to your base, so if you're strong enough (which is not a hard point to reach) it can become more of a nuisance then an actual raid.The map is very expansive, and there are many different areas to explore, all with their own pals.The building system is really nice in that it gives you freedom to place builds in any arrangement, anywhere within your base. However it does have a few issues that will need fixed. Certain builds cannot be placed under a roof despite there being enough room, but if you put the build first and then the roof, it will work. You also cannot place builds in water, despite it being shallow. I personally do not like this, as it means that making your base near a lake or river removes a bunch of space that you could be using. Builds also cannot be placed through certain natural terrain, which can leave gaps in builds or remove usable space all together. Aside from these issues, there are a lot of options, especially with the interior design, available with this building system and I quite enjoy it.Overall the game is a lot of fun right now, but still needs some work. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot at some point, especially if you enjoy free roam survival games.;Recommended;1449;47.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A great game, tons of fun ! I hope Pokemon make a survival game like this one.;Recommended;62;19.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've only gotten to about Level 27 in my play through, however, I will say I have had a lot of fun doing so.The base level up and work system are really cool, and there are a lot of options given the large variety of pals to choose from.The combat is a lot of fun, though, the boss fights can feel pretty repetitive after a while and not very dynamic. I love the dodging mechanic though.The raid system is pretty good as well. It keeps you on your toes and ensures that there is always action. However, the raid enemies will not attack you until they actually get to your base, so if you're strong enough (which is not a hard point to reach) it can become more of a nuisance then an actual raid.The map is very expansive, and there are many different areas to explore, all with their own pals.The building system is really nice in that it gives you freedom to place builds in any arrangement, anywhere within your base. However it does have a few issues that will need fixed. Certain builds cannot be placed under a roof despite there being enough room, but if you put the build first and then the roof, it will work. You also cannot place builds in water, despite it being shallow. I personally do not like this, as it means that making your base near a lake or river removes a bunch of space that you could be using. Builds also cannot be placed through certain natural terrain, which can leave gaps in builds or remove usable space all together. Aside from these issues, there are a lot of options, especially with the interior design, available with this building system and I quite enjoy it.Overall the game is a lot of fun right now, but still needs some work. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot at some point, especially if you enjoy free roam survival games.;Recommended;1449;47.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Been abused by Pokemon for a while and watching them defecate on a piece of toast, mark it as a game, and sell it for $60.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Let me start by saying i think this game is crazy fun and had a great start playing official servers. Started with 6 friends and we played for hours and hours before going to bed for days..........But then all the servers got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hackers and my guild went to three because people refunded or stopped playing. These Hackers started by stealing peoples PALs (monsters/pokemon) that were either placed at their bases and working or a mount, then they moved to using admin commands to force join guilds and start stealing items and materials then destroying bases. Now you have people TPing across the map and instantly killing players and stealing their dropped items and then doing all the above but now they are using bots to spam their sites to sell stolen Pals and stolen items. I really wanted to love this game and thought it was a great combo of other games into one but after these hackers and the lack of communication from BUG/Hacker reports from Palworld staff via their official email/website/discord i am lost faith in this game. i hope people read this prior to playing on any server because nothing sucks worse than playing hours and then losing it to someone who is trying to fill their lonely life by non stop hacking on all offical and some private servers. 1/10 would not play until this fixed -----------154 hours played and it was all gone/taken in less than 1 minute--------------;Not Recommended;1159;155.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;they are just making worse bugs everytime they fix anything they break like 3 more things that worked great before. fixxed a base issue about farms that completely broke my base that worked before. cant catch anything with the new bug where the thing to increase your rate of catch really makes it lower. cant even play the game cuz my base wont work anymore and i cant catch anything in a game about building up your base and catching things............. would request a refund if they dont get their heads out of their ass's soon.;Not Recommended;437;93.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've definitely enjoyed this game, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a good value for your entertainment dollar. That said, I want to note (without encouraging anyone to pass it up - it's still a good game), that it has an opportunity to have a much deeper gameplay loop which would push it even further.Currently, pal integration into the production loop is limited to operating production facilities. Access to technology is limited purely by XP, and the technology itself generally isn't terribly specialized. An actual research tree would make for a more interesting progression.Also, raids upon the base(s) could be a lot deeper and more interesting if the defenses (and the raiders) were more strategic - elemental defenses manned by appropriate pals, for example. Raiders also varying over time (and potentially by location) could make them more than an afterthought in base design - currently it's incredibly easy to take advantage of the pathing and make them trivial.So - it's a good game. It could be a great game with some additional work. Here's hoping!;Recommended;899;111.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ein wirklich sehr gutes Spiel! Fur ein EA Spiel, ist sehr viel kontent schon verbaut! Es gibt besser Reviews als meine, aber eins noch!Bitte lieber Programmier: Macht endlich ein Anticheat rein und macht was gegen die Haker! Es gibt da jemanden der viele kleine PalWorld Spieler/Streamer denen der Spaß daran genommen wird durch diesen einen Typen und seinen Spielverderber !!!;Recommended;318;106.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Why the negative review (for now)? Because, while the game has a LOT of stuff going for it, lots of features and content... For multiplayer server experience it is a complete broken mess.A few quick examples:- Pal's get stuck all the time and won't do their assigned (or automated) jobs.- Pal's are a nightmare to take care of, they need to be fed and medicine but frequently they won't eat available food because they get stuck OR they can't be interacted with to give medicine.- Combat is a pretty big part of the game with dodge mechanics and more. Unfortunately server lag makes this very difficult and unreliable. Pals will teleport around on you, get attacks off while they are inside a capture sphere, or just stand around doing nothing.- Some upgrades feel like they are impactful while others feel like they don't work at all.- Many of the systems like food going bad over time can be exploited very easily. One example, if you auto-sort your inventory it refreshes the counter on food...This is an early access game, once they fix multiplayer servers and some of these basic bugs I think this will be a great game and will happily change my review to positive!;Not Recommended;965;25.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;While this game may be rough around the edges, Pocket Pair have definitely struck gold with this game. I've never been interested in survival games, but Palworld has definitely got my interest, not just with the monster tamer mechanic, but how the Pals interact with the world and at your base. For example, It's cute to see one pal mine an ore deposit and watching another pal pick up the stone and put it in the supply crate. It was so adorable. Looking forward to how this game will continue in the future as well as any content that they will have planned once the base game is complete.;Recommended;483;5.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Finally a game that pulls in some of the best mechanics from so many different genres and somehow makes it work. The game loop is simple and charming. Catch pals, build a base, automate resource supply, battle stronger bosses. All this while exploring, crafting, doing dungeons and more. I can't wait to see what the completed game will be like.;Recommended;286;41.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is how early access games were meant to be — most of the way done and just looking for places to add the polish and fix bugs missed in development, not a glorified beta test that seems to be commonplace in this category nowadaysIf you’re looking at it because “pokeIn with guns”, I’m sorry to disappoint. It’s really more like Ark with Pokemon. There’s a huge emphasis on the base building grind/loop. Go get resources so you can add something to your base or upgrade it, rinse and repeat. The “Pals” just happened to be both a source of resources and your… unpaid laborers.I’ve seen a lot of people call it “the Pokémon game you always wanted”, but that’s not really true. Pretty much nothing about this game feels like Pokemon other than the pal designs. If anything it’s just something that scratches that “early access survival game” itch better than anything else has since maybe Subnautica, if not Minecraft.The dev team has been on fire since release. We’re about two weeks in at the time of this review, and already on version 1.4Great game, very fair price. Deserves all the success it’s had so far. I can easily see myself putting in over 100 hours before I’m done. Though, as it is with every survival base building game, you get out what you put into it.;Recommended;1044;66.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Honestly, i'm not a fan of Pokemon, but since a have really close friends who love that game, and the fact that they even said that this game is just not even closed to being compared to Pokemon in terms of content and gameplay, its just awesome as it is. You could say that the designs of the Pals are pretty similar to Pokemon, honestly, it doesn't matter at all, they look great and hopefully in future patches or DLC's, they add more variety of Pals.""Nintendo is just mad because they CAN make a game this good, but they are more money-hungry that they prefer to release copy-paste games than change the recipe for us fans""That's what one of my friends told me when he captured a Mammorest Lvl38 with his Univolt, Penking, and Warsect.Honestly, aside for the little bugs and kinda-bad optimization, this game is amazing, 9.5/10 hands down.";Recommended;694;32.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Only 6 hours in but really enjoying this game and having fun. Its not perfect, but its in early access. There are a few bugs, but overall its a great game, lots of fun, and I'd pay more $30 dollars for this game. Its charming, fun, and brings back a feeling of adventure to games, a lot of natural discovery. Do yourself a favor and just play, don't google and ruin the fun of exploration in this game.;Recommended;325;7.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The beginning of the game is super fun which I expected, but after a while i got bored grinding for levels. As soon as I unlocked the rifle there was a whole different way to play the game and all the small aspects like breeding farms and the pets helping you at your base make the game so much more fun. The fact that crafting pulls from chests is such an amazing feature I wished other games would follow with. In total best one of the best games I have every played and especially with the price tag it is worth every penny.;Recommended;425;15.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I played solo. It might be way better as a MP experience, but I just found it boring.Bigger numbers just don't excite or motivate me.The world is beautiful, but the single-player gameplay loop is just boring.The game takes some stabs and does some interesting things in the base building and automation area, but it felt like too much or implemented in a bulky way. The Palworld automation didn't easy my crafting experience, it just created a new micromanagement feature that only arbitrarily exists because they added a longer build time.I dunno.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;one of the best games i ve ever played;Recommended;30;6.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun game concept, pal designs, and exploration is satisfying, but there are some persistent issues right now.It takes a while to get guns (it took me around 20 hours without any guides), and until then, the combat is very basic.The survival crafting part of the game has many quality of life issues and bugs, which makes a major part of the game a slog, that will also gatekeep your ability to explore the world and catch pals. I would recommend waiting until the game is further along in it's development before aiming for a complete playthrough.I do wish there was an alternative way to catch pals other than beating them up to as close to death as possible for maximum catch success percentage. Maybe give them their favorite food. This would also make cooking the various perishable foods more useful, rather than sticking to a few that are easy to make and last the longest.;Not Recommended;725;20.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Genuinely enjoyable experience. It's buggy at times, but nothing is overly game breaking. All in all, it's very worth playing with some friends, and I can't wait for the full release.;Recommended;153;31.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It is a amazing game a lot like pokemon and incredibly fun a few bugs here and there but to be expected since it is Early Access but just to let you guys know about the bugs i'm adding it into this post you have to wait a minute after you log back in at times because a female avatar will appear with only one arm and it isn't my avatar then it would fix itself and my avatar would reappear, at time's the AI would get stuck and not be able to move and or attack and sometime's just the bug of after you would die you couldn't go to the nearest waypoint it wouldn't show then when you go to another waypoint then use the fast travel again it would show up and last one i have found ( and idk if it is intended ) was when you die you lose all you're items and have to run back to retrieve them and it is at times a little fusterating so if you could please add in a setting to disable it so on death you keep you're item's i would highly appreciate it but genuinely all in all this game is awesome I have found very few bugs and I play it everyday 10/10 imo recommend it if you like poke-battles incredible graphics and like enjoying catching and or riding these incredible pals to new and undiscovered lands there are manyyyy types to catch and use and you can even battle the bosses and then capture them at low health it's a experience to say I think every pokemon lover should play thank you for reading this if you did and hope you have a wonderful day/night and sleep well;Recommended;1184;13.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Genuinely enjoyable experience. It's buggy at times, but nothing is overly game breaking. All in all, it's very worth playing with some friends, and I can't wait for the full release.;Recommended;153;31.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It is a amazing game a lot like pokemon and incredibly fun a few bugs here and there but to be expected since it is Early Access but just to let you guys know about the bugs i'm adding it into this post you have to wait a minute after you log back in at times because a female avatar will appear with only one arm and it isn't my avatar then it would fix itself and my avatar would reappear, at time's the AI would get stuck and not be able to move and or attack and sometime's just the bug of after you would die you couldn't go to the nearest waypoint it wouldn't show then when you go to another waypoint then use the fast travel again it would show up and last one i have found ( and idk if it is intended ) was when you die you lose all you're items and have to run back to retrieve them and it is at times a little fusterating so if you could please add in a setting to disable it so on death you keep you're item's i would highly appreciate it but genuinely all in all this game is awesome I have found very few bugs and I play it everyday 10/10 imo recommend it if you like poke-battles incredible graphics and like enjoying catching and or riding these incredible pals to new and undiscovered lands there are manyyyy types to catch and use and you can even battle the bosses and then capture them at low health it's a experience to say I think every pokemon lover should play thank you for reading this if you did and hope you have a wonderful day/night and sleep well;Recommended;1184;13.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;4 oturuşta 25 saat. Ark ve Pokemon seviyorsanız bu oyunu (bugları haricinde sevmemeniz için hiçbir sebep yok. Oynanışı ve keşfetmesi Ark'tan daha akıcı ve eğlenceli. Pal'ları da Pokemon'dan... biraz daha waifu'msu...;Recommended;186;25.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Good;Recommended;4;87.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Overall: 5/10Would recommend, if you're willing to tolerate bugs and have a system that can handle a decent memory leak for your session length.The good:- It's what pokemon should be - open world and a bit of survival isn't bad. It's got decent AI for pals (pokemon), but there are still definitely some bugs in the game (esp. noticeable in multiplayer).- I got addicted to it pretty quickly.- The people I've played with on multiplayer also like it.The bad:- Blatent/near copy/paste in models eerily similar to other titles. Nintendo has already indicated their investigating copyright infringement, but they may not have a clear case in Pokemon.- The distribution (level and variety) of pals in the open world isn't quite there yet. The pals seem like they're semi-randomly distributed in some areas.- Raids (NPC raids on bases) can be unbalanced. (Oh, it's your first day and you just put down your base a minute ago? Here's 7 mobs coming toward you - hope you made a club and good luck.) ... This can be changed in server settings to toggle on/off, however.- A lot of the dungeons, while procedurally generated (a good thing), doesn't have enough variety yet and a generic dungeon rooms/hallways are reused quite a bit - this may change with time, and it's early yet, so it may improve, but can be a somewhat grindable/source of ore, sulfur, and coal.- The sheer number of copy/paste assets/lookalikes could be a bad thing, and has turned people away.- There are some basic textures that mesh poorly (water textures that clip so you see where it starts/ends; skybox with a clear start/end; occassional terrain that simply pokes through solid rock for no apparent reason, and some gatherables that spawn below the ground/unreachable).- Sometimes the bosses can bug out and be stuck/attatched to your person with super speed, so you can't get away - and you get 3 shot if you have all defenses up (attatched to you, it ignores your pals).- The human AI is dumb as ****, just climb to some elevation and they'll just sit around and be sniped unless they have range on you.Notable items:- Interestingly, you can capture the humans just like any pal... they make for pretty poor workers/defenders, however.- There's a somewhat disturbing set of craftables...- A butcher cleaver that allows you to slaughter pals (including humans). A mosaic effect appears around your character/the butchered pal when doing so, but disappears right before the body does. Some models' butcher animations leave the mosaic while being butchered (looking at you, cinnamoth).- A ""monitoring tower"" that allows you to overwork your pals (concentration camp style).- A viewing box craftable that allows you to put pals on display like a zoo/exhibits (could be okay in like a trophy room, but seems more like prison cells/scientific observation rooms).In summary:Would I play it knowing what I know about it and not having had the game yet? Yes.Is there replayability?Somewhat... once you fill your pokedec- erm, paldeck, there's not a whole lot to do. Pokemon with guns and survival is a bit fun in and of itself, however. Add other people, and it's definitely got things going for it.Would I recommend it to others?It depends on a few things:- Basic multiplayer allows max 4 players on a server (unless you modify settings/set up a dedicated/public - requires basic networking knowledge - not for the layman gamer).- If the blatant copy/paste of assets is tolerable, it's a decent enough game already.Review Metrics:Graphics: 7/10- Memory leaks will crash games with enough time... otherwise, with a good graphics card, this could be a 9/10- There are MANY poorly meshed texturesUser Interface: 5/10- The ability to name/rename your pals is a little cumbersome.- You can't cancel a knocked arrow/you have to use menus creatively to conserve ammo. You can, however, cancel throwing a pokeba- palsphere (inconsistency).- Some status conditions do not have a clear cause or resolution. While medicine can cure conditions, what medicine is appropriate is not always clear.- The type chart is a little buried in the help ""Survival"" menu - it's not spelled out that there's type advantages like in pokemon... it could be inferred, but someone completely new could be lost.UX/Gameplay: 6/10- Despite some of the drawbacks above, it's still something enjoyable for me and I feel it illustrates how easy something like this could have been implemented by Nintendo for pokemon, but they've chosen not to.- Despite the number of bugs, I'm giving them a pass here for now due to the early access and displayed warnings to expect bugs, memory leak aside - that one needs to be addressed, as it kills multiplayer.Some things are confusing:- Default settings allow max 4 players, but 20 guilds?- Object clutter on bases don't despawn/count toward object counts (possible contributor to memory leaks?).- Pals that are not rendered (far enough from your base or offline on a persistent server), do not actually eat, but their hunger meters still decrease despite food at the base, so they starve and then have medical issues when you return after a long enough period/you were afk away from your base. It doesn't become fun when you're managing three bases on solo play and one consistently ends up needing significant time investment to address all the medical needs because you stepped away for a bit.Uniqueness: 2/10- Points for the combination of Ark: Survival Evolved and Pokemon, but the sheer number of copy/paste takes away most of the value here.";Recommended;4604;102.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I like the concept of the game and how you can build with the help of PALs. I dislike how the PALs will not stay at the desired location you want them to work on instead of running on auto help mode, I dislike how they keep fusing through walls and getting stuck outside or in the ground. Lastly, past several days the PALs have not been acting right and start resulting to glitch walking or following me around in base.;Recommended;340;92.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;For EA it's solid, very fun loop. I'm hoping there will be a lot more content added around building/crafting/customization, cleaning up some visual bugs and inventory management, build out actual cities to visit, but great game.;Recommended;193;22.0;

Yes it's REALLY buggy (turn off item drops on death for you sanity's sake). But Pocketpair knew what they wanted to make, had a passion for it, and it shows. This is very very quickly becoming my all time favorite game. My only two urgent complaints about the game are climbing being really really buggy, at least for me, and captured humans being relatively worthless.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I find it to be more realistic this way. I mean if these creatures are out to eat and or kill you one should be able to defend themselves too, I mean anything goes which is why I like this game. Hope they add more content soon and get things fixed!;Recommended;198;26.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Your own production line of monsters to help you produce all of your survival needs, more survival games could learn a thing from this concept, makes the game feel less lonely, all while allowing you to have to spend less time gathering resources and more time being creative or having fun.;Recommended;240;69.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Love the game, very cute, the best game ever for people who love Pokemon, and also Survival GameI think , Palworld should lowered their Minimum system requirement if possible for RAM especiallybecause there are many player who wanted to play the game, already purchased it but can't play itbecause of their low spec system. I have minimum specs, and still shutting down while playing the game.there's to many crashes, maybe because it's still early access.;Recommended;382;50.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A great blend of Pokemon, ARK, and a few others. The game looks beautiful, and despite having a lot going on it runs almost seamlessly on my old rig which I appreciate. I have been playing solo so I can't speak to servers, and the game is still in early access so I'm sure they'll fix the AI/pathing for Pals and some glitches around the base which don't detract from the gameplay much for me. I'm really excited to see what this game looks like fully released, and am really enjoying the focus on base-building and the way the Pals tie into keeping a base running while managing their happiness. The occasional raids on the base, ability to raid enemy bases, and defeating bosses that the map keeps track of for you are also fun additions. Overall the game seems pretty balanced on single player and I'm enjoying it quite a lot.;Recommended;678;24.3;

When you try to log back on to your base, you find out that its been destroyed and the new guild member is now not in your guild anymore. Until this is patched out, I will be retiring this game.

The graphics are beautifully crafted, drawing me into its fantastical world from the very beginning. The stunning visuals, combined with the intuitive gameplay mechanics, made every moment spent in Palworld truly enjoyable. The element of levelling and interacting with pals is not only fun but also adds a unique twist to the gameplay that I found incredibly engaging. I particularly enjoyed the exploration aspect of the game, as it allowed me to discover new territories and resources to expand my world. The crafting options are diverse and satisfying, offering endless possibilities for customization and creation.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"It is like Ark Survival Evolved, but with Pokemons instead of Dinos. I'm only giving it a thumbs up, because so far I had decent fun. However, I certainly enjoyed Ark more than this. So I recommend it if you just want to screw around for maybe 20-30 hours, but if you are looking for a long term game, then in its current state, this is not it.There are some differences other than visual, but I would say that it boils down to Palworld being more dependant on pets. A lot of the tasks in Palworld just take too long or are not possible to do by yourself, so you just throw a pet at the job and do something else in the meantime.Sadly, at the moment implementation of task management is so bad, that it is actually worse than the solution Ark has, where you just put the mats into facility and tell it to work by itself. So don't expect Rimworld with pokemons here.Big bases you see in official screenshots and videos, with rows of pets hauling and processing mats? Not possible, because you have max of 20 pets per base.Pets here have I guess more interesting combat? In Ark they usually just bite or smack you with their body, but here they have some abilities that they often use, like in Pokemon I guess.I'm not a fan of RNG catching of pets; in Ark you could calculate how much you need of the stuff in order to get a pet, but here you could fail 10 times in a row with 95% success, or catch something on the first try at 5% rate. Not a deal breaker, but taming dinos in Ark felt much more invested for me, especially when I was still a begginer it really felt like a challenge and achievement.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;amazing game because theres bosses, opps, funny bugs, big boi pals, 111 different types of them and breeding, fangirls, raids, legendarys, saddles, flamethrowers, rocketlaunchers, mounted missle launchers, base building, slaver- i mean hard workers, enemy bases, and so much more! please buy the game rn dude/girl its an amazing game i reccomend BUT. it does take a toll on a laptop, just make sure you have the best type of laptop or a good one at that!;Recommended;378;32.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"It is like Ark Survival Evolved, but with Pokemons instead of Dinos. I'm only giving it a thumbs up, because so far I had decent fun. However, I certainly enjoyed Ark more than this. So I recommend it if you just want to screw around for maybe 20-30 hours, but if you are looking for a long term game, then in its current state, this is not it.There are some differences other than visual, but I would say that it boils down to Palworld being more dependant on pets. A lot of the tasks in Palworld just take too long or are not possible to do by yourself, so you just throw a pet at the job and do something else in the meantime.Sadly, at the moment implementation of task management is so bad, that it is actually worse than the solution Ark has, where you just put the mats into facility and tell it to work by itself. So don't expect Rimworld with pokemons here.Big bases you see in official screenshots and videos, with rows of pets hauling and processing mats? Not possible, because you have max of 20 pets per base.Pets here have I guess more interesting combat? In Ark they usually just bite or smack you with their body, but here they have some abilities that they often use, like in Pokemon I guess.I'm not a fan of RNG catching of pets; in Ark you could calculate how much you need of the stuff in order to get a pet, but here you could fail 10 times in a row with 95% success, or catch something on the first try at 5% rate. Not a deal breaker, but taming dinos in Ark felt much more invested for me, especially when I was still a begginer it really felt like a challenge and achievement. Here you just keep throwing pokeballs until you get lucky or run out + I guess you can use some debuffs that increase rates.";Recommended;1395;23.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is tons of fun, at time of writing I have about 60 hours of playtime.It goes without saying, there are bugs, especially in the base pathing and assigned tasks, logging in after a day with base Pals depressed, sicked and weakened, costing tons of resources in meds... There are workarounds to every issue currently, they'll fix it in due time...But overall, being released in EA for only about a week and a few days, Great fun! Devs are releasing updates every fortnight or so, all in all worth getting your hands dirty and catching some Pals!;Recommended;455;64.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I have never been shackled to a game so tightly than this one. It has completely taken over my life. I have lost all sense of self and can only live through this game. My life has been ruined, I have lost my job, lost my friends, lost my family, all for this game. It's the only thing I have now. At least I have cool pals.;Recommended;257;82.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I enjoy this game very much- I've seen a lot of commentary that it's a Pokemon clone but tbh I feel that it gives you some of the best parts of a couple different games. The sound design, map aesthetic and fast travel mechanics remind me very heavily of Breath of the Wild- you can climb walls, use a hang glider, even the symbols and the notification sound that play when a player collects a new fast travel point for the first time are highly reminiscent of the series. Then of course you get the cool creatures that everyone compares to Pokemon. And I don't disagree, really. There are only so many ways you can design fictional monsters in a game like this without scooting into Pokemon territory, and frankly I don't think the game deserves the flack it's been catching on that end of the equation. But the breeding system is completely different and adds something fresh to the game that Pokemon failed to capitalize on: players can breed different types of Pals to create other species, and in fact it is one of the best ways to obtain certain Pals if my understanding is correct.The building mechanics are fun and easy, as well, and the occasional raid on a player's base keeps things from getting too mundane- I am not a fan of games where you have to spend hours and hours grinding for something as simple as building materials, and this game is pretty forgiving in that area. Players also level up at a respectable rate of speed and therefore can advance pretty quickly, especially in groups.If there's anything at all I would offer some feedback on, it's the following:1) I would like to see either a larger map or potentially alternative maps within the same universe, especially if they're accessible by the player after beating certain bosses or unlocking certain areas of the map. I can see the current map getting repetitive after a couple of playthroughs, which I would love to see this dev team avoid.2) The Pals' pathing on base can be a little buggy, flying Pals will sometimes just randomly get stuck on the roof of a player's house, some larger Pals like Mozzarina occasionally have difficulty getting into the Ranch to work, etc.3) If you're playing in a group and someone is off adventuring and gets downed, there is no icon on the HUD compass to show other players where they are to go and revive them, and the downed player's name doesn't consistently appear upon approach- I am not sure if this is a bug or just the game design, but I think that is something that could be improved.4) My final feedback is that there are quite a few NPCs scattered across the island who don't really do anything with the player other than give them a few supplies and some flavor text about the islands. I would love to see Questing added to the game, where players can perform tasks for the NPCs and earn rewards- for example, helping save the small settlement near the starting area fend off a wild Pal or Syndicate attack to improve your standing with them and earn like a stack of 10 pal spheres or something simple. It would do a lot to make things even more engaging, and give larger groups something to focus on.All of this being said, it's a fantastic game with great design (so far), and I look forward to seeing what the devs are able to accomplish with it in the future :)8/10;Recommended;2704;40.8;

There need to be more challenges, like either more dungeons or more challenging fights (only allowed to use certain pals or don't use pals at all etc.). In the meantime, as this is Early Access, it's definitely a ""what Pokemon could have been"" and better.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Incredibly addictive.My only ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with this game is the AI getting stuck on things in your bases. This can be counteracted by giving clear paths and lots of room for each thing they need to do, but even then they'll get caught on things or just stop working.Mods are going to make this game even more wonderful if map expansions and adding (not replacing) Pals gets introduced.If I had friends, that would take this game from an A- to an S I bet.Probably the best game released in the past year for me.;Recommended;412;28.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;SLAVERY;Recommended;7;21.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I highly enjoy the satire of this whole game. It is the anti-Pokemon Pokemon game mixed with the dark humor of our industrial society. The pacing is quick to get into mid/end game, just as quickly as you'll forget your first 30 Lamballs. Most games of this size has much to explore, but not much reward to do so. It really feels like the developers really wanted you to go out and uncover it all by placing literal Easter eggs and treasure in the most odd places. However, this game like many other survival games can get tedious with the grind, but unlike other ones this one feels a bit short. Then again... this is not a finished game.;Recommended;520;64.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game sure filled a niche for two publics that were left disappointed lately, Ark players with the release of the abysmal failure of the new Ark game and Pokémon players who have been neglected by Game Freak for quite a while now, sure the game still is buggy but lets remember, it is EARLY ACCESS(extremely early access for that matter), of course most of it is pure hype and a lot of its playerbase will die down in the months to come(I admit, even I am already feeling the burnout of it, hell, even missed a couple of days of work on its first week after launch) until the next shiny thingy comes out, that doesn't mean the game itself will, pretty sure it will still maintain a solid and healthy playerbaseFinal note: My brothers and sisters in Christ don't be like me, do not miss work OR school for a freaking game, I made a mistake and regret doing so, godspeed to you all;Recommended;718;133.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This is gonna be an in-depth review because given all of the attention around this game right now, i think its important to get other reviews out there other than ""its such and such with guns!"" I don't want to bring attention to that but rather showcase why Palworld is so unique & why its been such a raging success.~PLEASE NOTE THERE WILL BE SPOILERS~Palworld is a cute little sandbox game where you can go on adventures, build bases and catch creatures called Pals to fight/adventure & build along side you. However unlike most games, Palworld doesn't decide your morality for you. Huh? I hear you asking ~ well, the thing is almost any living thing in Palworld can be a Pal...Including other humans.Yup you read that right. & the rule of thumb is (just about) anything you can do to a animal Pal ~ you can do to a human one. But more specifically butchering and selling Pals. Butchering pals offers different supplies based on the Pal itself. Some give food, leather, claws, furs for armor, ect. Selling Pals provides coins you can use at merchants. Both are rather useful mechanics but people are people and saw an opportunity to meme with this function and ran with it. I want to stress that the game doesn't necessarily encourage these actions. In fact when you try to catch a passive human, you end up with a ""wanted"" status and guards start spawning out of nowhere to try to stop you from catching a human. The game itself tells you its frowned upon. It just doesn't stop you from doing so if that's how you really choose to play the game.It's actually created a very diverse experience for players & i find that to be something worth celebrating.Lets continue yes?So you got a pocket full of Pals now (I've been calling them PocketPals. I feel like it fits the memeish attitude of the community and it just rolls off the tongue nicely.) but now what? Well now we go out and find a place to set up base and get everyone working. Your PocketPals will help you build your base, cook your foods, craft your items, they will graze and provide items, chop trees, carve stones, you name it. All of the jobs you have to do around your base camp ~ there is a PocketPal with a special skill set that can help you! But again, morality. Because its not something the game decides for you, you can either choose to love and nurture your PocketPals ~ giving them the best life while they work along side you to make you the best there is.OR~You can choose to be a d♦♦♦. Working your Pals to the point of ""death"".{ I want to note here that i've yet to see a Pal actually work to death. Ive only seen them get to the point that they pass out and you need to put them on bed rest. however i do not choose to push my Pals in such a manner so I don't know if you can actually kill your Pals bu over working them.}But I do know that there are people who choose the path in which they push their Pals harder and use them almost like any common tool. Again, the game says ""maybe this isn't the best idea"" but they don't stop you from doing it. They let you choose your path. For PvP lobbies i see this being huge! I really do think there will be guilds that clash and war because 1 sees the Pals as friends and the other sees them as tools. Which even as a generally peaceful player ~ even i like the idea behind that. It just allows for more content!Since its release & at the time of writing this I have 147.4 hours on Palworld and i honestly look forward to seeing it on my Steam Year Review at the end of 2024. It took us all of 10 mins to decide to rent a dedicated server & half of that was spent choosing which provider we wanted to use. I've explored so much of the map. I dedicated a whole base to breeding and spent hours just trying to get the perfect mount builds. There's so many ways to play and really get lost in this world & with the road-map they gave us there's gonna be even more and I for one am super excited about it.Sooooo there's all the good! Now here's the ""bad""• Buggy Game-play •obviously. Its early access they are working on it. I don't personally knock them for it cause i know they have announced they are working on it however if you're someone who absolutely cannot stand bugs and would actually leave a negative review knowing its in early access ~ just wait to buy the game. wait until they work out the kinks. nothing is dumber than listening to yall piss and moan that a game that's been out less than a month isn't working perfectly. especially when its in early access.There are a couple mechanics that could be tweaked a little for quality of life as well.• Storage Crates •Pals help you store things while working. Some storage will take priority over others. Like if you have a fridge they will seem to put (most) of the food items in the fridge instead of in a box. However you have to work to get a pathing right and for items that aren't food they kinda just put it wherever. ~ I think a partial solution to this would be to add a function in the locking section that just straight up you click the button and it locks pals out of it. That way if you want a chest that's just armor or fruits or whatever and don't want your pals just shoving crap in there ~ they wont. It could help with at least a small portion of the chaos that is organization.• Feed bags •As it stands all they do (or rather are supposed to do ~ it seems like they might not work some of the time) is make it so your person and pals eat without you having to pull out your backpack. However like stated, sometimes you still have to move the food out of the feed bag and use it. But i think if in addition to fixing that ~ maybe make it so the feed bags make the food weightless or at least weigh less. I feel like it could add even more value to the feed bags.• Bases •we need more than 3. I understand there are mods out there but not everyone likes installing mods and it can actually be really difficult to get larger servers with more people to have everyone install the same mods. 3 bases just isn't enough. especially if you are solo playing.• Dungeons •these are a great concept but they need more OOMPH. and i don't mean crank up the difficulty but rather they just need to be filed out more. these dungeons are huge but the majority of it is empty corridors and the pals nor the resources inside are worth the trouble. I think they need to have more chests ~ exclusive pals and resources that can ONLY be found in the dungeon. Or maybe exclusive cave fruit? cave eggs? A boss at the end that's somehow special? Maybe its a lucky? Maybe it has better passive skills? that would really be upto the devs to decide how to really boost the incentive but it DOES need the overhaul. as it stand dungeons are kinda useless. if your difficulty is set to the normal (drop everything) then the risk is no where near worth the reward. But i do love the idea of an extra instance! But use the instance to shake things up a little more.Overall though ~ Palworld is a solid sandbox/adventure experience!Rather you're running the best ranch west of the river or the harshest sweat shop on the east, is entirely upto the player.There are many types of PocketPals to find and even more coming! My friends and i look forward in seeing what they have instore and watching as the game continues to flourish. Its been an amazing time and worth every minuet. Even after having to restart our server due to issues on the hosts end.I personally find it to be more fun than the games its been compared to.Its a truly unique experience and the world is just so damn beautiful.I hope once people start drawing and submitting their own PocketPals that PocketPair learns from the mistakes of its predecessors and actually listens to/uses and compensates players for their designs.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is an awesome exploring game where it's not the same as Pokemon with multiple features a stamina meter, you can even fight the pals yourself, not turned base, fight bosses with you and your pals, you need to fill out your map, and more!;Recommended;197;16.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Love seeing how those silly little Dead By Daylight Devs are crying over their jealousy about this game. Silly little crybabies. Oh wow and they're still crying.This is how you create a game, FOR your gamers and with respect for your gamers by not charging them for each new character you put into the game. Keep up the great work PocketPair!!!;Recommended;284;60.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Addictive. Entertaining. Funny. Cute and Adorable. As it states its in early access so there's a lot of bugs and credit to the devs there addressing them quickly. Still tho an absolute hit and Ill be surprised if its not a contender for game of the year. Id give it a 9/10 only because of the bugs. This game has so much potential.;Recommended;269;126.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Highly reccomend this game. I have lost track of how many times my wife has said to me, "" Make sure you go to bed at a good time, you have work tomorrow! "" Palworld is a diamond of a game. There's untapped potential in it to increase on the lore tenfold and for an early release game, I'm absolutely bewildered on how smooth and bugfree it is. It has basically zero bugs now as of 2 weeks after launch and the developers keep pushing quality of life upgrades currently to benefit everyone.The survival aspect is smooth, the building could use SOME work but overall its great. The combat is great for a PAL focused game, I could see improvements being made to the combat system itself though.I give it 9/10 will play for long time";Recommended;594;50.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is CRAZY I can't get enough of it. 5/5 stars.;Recommended;44;11.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It is like a cross between the game Ark and the game Pokemon.It is fun if you are willing to endure a massive grind, and if you have a desire to repeatedly catch the same Palmon over and over to get the best Pals with the best traits that you can find.The game itself is pretty fun and very enjoyable, as it provides a lot to do and a lot to see, but sadly a lot of it is stuck behind grinding.There is tragically a severe lack of NPC interaction and Pal interaction at the moment, and there is a severe lack in the ability to get quests and do shopping, but that is because the game is still in the Earliest parts of Early Access, and a lot more content is bound to be added eventually.The Devs are really active, and have been patching tons of bugs and doing quality of life improvements, so the game has a really active studio and development team behind it and is going to make the game better with time.This game is worth getting, it has a lot of potential to get better, it is good as it is, and it will be amazing as it gets worked on more and more.;Recommended;848;29.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A very silly game with a bright future. Part monster collector, part survival, part exploration, there's a lot to engage with if that appeals to you. Want to build a non-euclidian base out of stone? Sure.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;These devs care. It doesn't take long for a company to show its true colors after release if you ask me, and in my personal opinion, Palworld has shown quite solidly that they are receptive to their playerbase. Not a week had gone by before they roll out major patches to fix most, if not all of the major bugs that were in the way of enjoying the game, and they clearly know their audience.For example, previously, when overencumbered the only way to move was to use a grappling hook or a pal move, now were this most companies, they might have patched out the grappling hook to make encumberance more punishing. Pocketpair's answer? Make it possible to move albeit slowly as heck and still allow the grapple hook. Rather than limit player options, they saw an emergent aspect of gameplay come out of their game and left it be. Other devs could learn from that mindset.The game is genuinely fun, and even in its early access state with some clear areas that could use improvement (Pal variety and making the open world feel a bit more full to name a few), I have faith that those things will come in time.For the first time in quite some time, I have a company who I actually firmly trust in.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Pokemon fans: You deserve better. And better is here. That, or go play Pokemon Insurgence. Actually, if you want a good story, go play Pokemon Insurgence, Palworld's story is pretty lacking.Anyway, you can make sheep work a palsphere sweatshop, and have fire foxes smelt ingots for you. You can lead a small party of gun-toting leaf monkeys into battle, and ride a fire lion into the sunset. It's a good time, unless survival-crafting games make you see red. And if you have reservations about the rumors about animal abuse or slavery, just remember: The inspiration for this game is baby's first dogfighting simulator. One of the games had you fight an organization that had the end goal of freeing every pokemon from their trainers. (Pokemon Black and White.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"What this game lacks in depth, it makes up for in charm. Palworld's hype is centred around the latter, yet you may want to hold off on picking up this game until it has addressed the former.While there are elements of survival and base automation, the game centres around hunting creatures by either capturing or killing them to grind through a tech tree and grind for animal products for crafting.The start of the game has you capturing Pals and building a base, and I found a lot of enjoyment in getting set up. Despite being a survival game of sorts, I had no struggle with inventory management and picking up early resources, the biggest frustration being unable to move buildings and workbenches. Pals help out around your base with delightful mannerisms, giving you a sense of their character. You are also given plenty of time to learn and experiment with the basic mechanics of combat and base building, which I appreciated.Pals assigned to your base can become stressed, and they might ""slack off"" and stress eat through your food supplies, but there are no early game mechanisms for the player to address this issue other than 'storing' the Pal away and replacing them with another Pal. More experienced players seem to opt to ""butcher"" the offending Pal before replacing them. I would have loved some early game structures and better variety of options to address Pal's emotional needs. Rather, the game is content with having you grind to collect as many Pals as possible and gives you no reason to form attachment to any of them.In fact, Palworld seems to nudge you to believe that that Pals are to be treated with disdain. I can only assume such disdain is used to justify repetitively capturing Pals to grind experience points. Why is the game telling me I need to collect 30 Pals? Why do I need 10 of each type to get bonus experience? Surely the player should be the judge of how many Pals they need to manage their base and accompany them on journeys? A more meaningful game objective would be to tell the player to capture the right types of Pal to operate the base structures the player is being told to build - for the early game this would have at least guided me on what Pals to attain for which tasks. The NPCs scattered around do little to help enrich the world building, and their shallow dialog detracts from it if anything.Building a community of creatures and collecting new species, especially of a more challenging variety, is where my enjoyment was rooted. The real-time battles are certainly fun, but the early Pals do not put up any real fight, giving you a sense of being overpowered. In fact, the biggest frustration for me was accidentally killing Pals before you can capture them - which is the norm rather than the exception once you have even some basic weapons and Pals to aid your fights.Palworld seems to try to appeal to audiences of creature capture and monster hunter games who were looking for something slightly different, but not too different. I like the idea of creature capture games, but I was never able to get into the series of games Palworld tries to imitate, and I suspect this is why Palworld falls short for me. I do not like grinding without meaning. The addition of a story, or more focus on the role-playing aspect of the game would have certainly sold me on the concept.I would love to be given choices that would allow for me to form meaningful connections with my Pals or with the world itself, but alas, I must capture yet another dozen Pals to grind through the tech tree.";Not Recommended;2914;4.2;

You are also given plenty of time to learn and experiment with the basic mechanics of combat and base building, which I appreciated.Pals assigned to your base can become stressed, and they might ""slack off"" and stress eat through your food supplies, but there are no early game mechanisms for the player to address this issue other than 'storing' the Pal away and replacing them with another Pal. More experienced players seem to opt to ""butcher"" the offending Pal before replacing them. I would have loved some early game structures and better variety of options to address Pal's emotional needs. Rather, the game is content with having you grind to collect as many Pals as possible and gives you no reason to form attachment to any of them.In fact, Palworld seems to nudge you to believe that that Pals are to be treated with disdain. I can only assume such disdain is used to justify repetitively capturing Pals to grind experience points. Why is the game telling me I need to collect 30 Pals? Why do I need 10 of each type to get bonus experience? Surely the player should be the judge of how many Pals they need to manage their base and accompany them on journeys? A more meaningful game objective would be to tell the player to capture the right types of Pal to operate the base structures the player is being told to build - for the early game this would have at least guided me on what Pals to attain for which tasks. The NPCs scattered around do little to help enrich the world building, and their shallow dialog detracts from it if anything.Building a community of creatures and collecting new species, especially of a more challenging variety, is where my enjoyment was rooted. The real-time battles are certainly fun, but the early Pals do not put up any real fight, giving you a sense of being overpowered. In fact, the biggest frustration for me was accidentally killing Pals before you can capture them - which is the norm rather than the exception once you have even some basic weapons and Pals to aid your fights.Palworld seems to try to appeal to audiences of creature capture and monster hunter games who were looking for something slightly different, but not too different. I like the idea of creature capture games, but I was never able to get into the series of games Palworld tries to imitate, and I suspect this is why Palworld falls short for me. I do not like grinding without meaning. The addition of a story, or more focus on the role-playing aspect of the game would have certainly sold me on the concept.I would love to be given choices that would allow for me to form meaningful connections with my Pals or with the world itself, but alas, I must capture yet another dozen Pals to grind through the tech tree.";Not Recommended;2914;4.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Who knew breeding up the ultimate battle ready inbred chicken meant that I had to make a spider web of its family tree. Palworld is a remarkably fantastic game especially for one that calls itself Early Access as it currently stands. Palworld's mechanics and game play feels to me as if a lot of it was inspired by so many other games, yet they implemented everything extremely well. The developers took all the best mechanics you would find in other games and then near seamlessly bound them all together where everything works in such an insanely fun and engaging way. Everything about this game scratched that itch I did not know I had with monster taming and base building games. I have had a disgusting amount of fun just wandering around and hiring new unpaid interns to build up my bases, and re-educate the locals. The combat is everything I could have ever dreamed of with what is best described as a souls like monster dog fight. For the price Palworld is I am astounded at how large the map is, and how much content there already is. In my heart this is already game of the year, and yet it came out at the very beginning of the year. I one hundred percent recommend this even at full price or more.;Recommended;989;104.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;For a game that is in early access it is extremely fun. It is very easy to get stuck playing this game for hours upon hours. There is tons to do. You can spend hours trying to make your base look cool or trying to collect pals with the best passive skill buffs, or just exploring the huge map and finding new pals you haven't seen yet. I love this game so far and the devs seem to appreciate the love the game has gotten because they are constantly fixing bugs and updating it regularly.Obviously there are some cons, but keep in mind this is an early access game.- It can be pretty buggy. Sometimes it is hard to get the pals in your base to do exactly what they are supposed to do.- My biggest complaint so far is that even though the world is huge sometimes it feels empty. I didn't expect it to feel fully fleshed out yet but when I decide I'm going to just free roam around the map and look for new stuff, I feel like I see the same pals over and over again.- Base building in games is one of my favorite things, and there is plenty of choice for designing your base but some objects don't snap properly or have texture glitches when attached to each other (like the stone walls and roof pieces).- Overall gameplay bugs. The amount of times I have logged on to my single-player world and my character is glitched through the map and is drowning is insane. I would reccomend changing the world settings to not drop items on death just to protect yourself from losing everything every time this happens. There is also a pretty strong rumor on reddit, that improving your catch rate actually makes it worse. Which honestly feels like it is probably true. The good thing about some of these bugs is that you are able to change a lot of the world settings to make your world play the way you want it to and also allow a small work around for bugs until they get fixed.Overall, I think it is totally worth buying. I am happy paying a discounted price now, to help the devs create a better finished product, from what is already an addicting and fun game, than I am paying full price for games that are unfinished and have a mountain of micro-transactions.;Recommended;1749;58.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I instantly regretted this buy! This has to be THE ONE game I will not allow in my house.This is a clearly disturbed game, and let me tell you why:The 20 minutes i got to play. casually my 6 year old daughter watched me and asked if I was playing Fortnite. which apparently looks the same. The game mechanics felt immediately like they mediocre game Craftoria.The Maps looks super clean and empty still there is a lot of bugs I encounter. Well I get its an Early Stage but wait there is more....I walked around my daughter asked if I could be friend with this Pal Pokemon copies, sadly that's not the point of this game. I tried not to tell her the point of this game is to Enslave this pals. The moment I punched a pal, she began to cry... And so I stopped for a little while to talk to her.My 10 year old came out his door and wondered why is his sister crying. He immediately recognized Pal word due to watching streamers. Then he started to tell stories of the enslaving of the Pals, and where he had kinda of a evil tone laughing, witch made me sad and his sister even more angry. And so I became angry too, thinking witch kind of sick game is this.I can tell this is a product put togheter to mess with peoples mind, and its just SAD VERY SAD. Its looks cool because of the Pokemons and Fortnite looks, but its dressed up as a wanna be survival game mechanics to steal your time and dopamine. SPECIALLY YOUNG KIDS. It teach you to misbehave with animals, witch is this case PALS, and so its sad that are plenty of people playing this ♥♥♥♥.;Not Recommended;1250;0.2;

But what makes me really excited is the future of the game.'? ?'Either way, I will try my best to make sure I am there for the game., you have an important mission here, so good luck, and I hope for the best!;Recommended;454;90.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I instantly regretted this buy! This has to be THE ONE game I will not allow in my house.This is a clearly disturbed game, and let me tell you why:The 20 minutes i got to play. casually my 6 year old daughter watched me and asked if I was playing Fortnite. which apparently looks the same. The game mechanics felt immediately like they mediocre game Craftoria.The Maps looks super clean and empty still there is a lot of bugs I encounter. Well I get its an Early Stage but wait there is more....I walked around my daughter asked if I could be friend with this Pal Pokemon copies, sadly that's not the point of this game. I tried not to tell her the point of this game is to Enslave this pals. The moment I punched a pal, she began to cry... And so I stopped for a little while to talk to her.My 10 year old came out his door and wondered why is his sister crying. He immediately recognized Pal word due to watching streamers. Then he started to tell stories of the enslaving of the Pals, and where he had kinda of a evil tone laughing, witch made me sad and his sister even more angry. And so I became angry too, thinking witch kind of sick game is this.I can tell this is a product put togheter to mess with peoples mind, and its just SAD VERY SAD. Its looks cool because of the Pokemons and Fortnite looks, but its dressed up as a wanna be survival game mechanics to steal your time and dopamine. SPECIALLY YOUNG KIDS. It teach you to misbehave with animals, witch is this case PALS, and so its sad that are plenty of people playing this ♥♥♥♥.;Not Recommended;1250;0.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Extremely Unoptimized but FunI enjoy this game a lot but i cannot recommend it to most ppl, as in its current state it is hideously unoptimized, even at low settings on, what is admittedly an aging system (1660 Ti, RX 3800X, 16gb RAM), I was getting 30 fps averages that slowly crept down to about 20-25and after entering any dungeon my framerate fell to less than 15 average until i restartedAdditionally, the motion blur is ALWAYS ON unless you got edit a file which, is strange. the off setting should turn it offOtherwise the game is fun, it plays like any standard survival-crafty open world game, just with little guys you can capture and utilize which is fun so if you (like me) dont mind putting up with some major jank its pretty fun;Not Recommended;609;7.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Unlike my brothers and cousins, I never really got into Pokemon, but I really dig this game.It has most of the things I liked from games like Minecraft, Colony Survival, and Satisfactory, in a cuter and less stressful package.Don't get me wrong, this game is dark, but it's also a lot more wholesome than I thought it would be.You get more EXP from catching Pals rather than killing them, and you still get their drop materials as well with a successful catch, which doesn't make sense, but imo it's a neat system, and there are several more in the game, that rewards players for ""good behavior"".The game works well for the most part, but there are the occasional bugs and performance issues that one would expect from an early access game, but this game certainly has the potential to be one of the greatest games of all time.";Recommended;680;36.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;All good except the dependency on ingots which starts off early game and persists through even into late game is painful, why does everything NEED ingots and why SO MUCH OF IT TOO?????????Prepare for ingot grind, levels are a bit hard to get early on, best way to do it is to explore and capture new creatures. Will update with time.;Recommended;273;3.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Definitely a fun game. Good visual style. It does need some tuning though. The AI pathing is a major problem right now. Since there is no inter-base transport, a lot of materials have be shuffled around by the player in the later game. It would be one thing if it was near the beginning of the game, but late in the game the last thing you want to be doing is running ingots from one base to another taking multiple trips.They have been working mainly on critical bugs and anti-cheat right now but I do think they will listen to the players and start fixing these issues once they get some breathing room.;Recommended;493;18.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This has a lot of potential to be an extremely good game. I played 8 hrs and i enjoyed it so far. still a lot to do. They can transform this game in something huge. With much more quests, pvp, different worlds even more construction settings, raid bosses etc;Recommended;210;9.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is an exceptional game, let alone early access game, that has the potential to be the best of its genre. Let’s talk about it.TLDR: It’s Pokémon styled creature-collector mashed together with ARK and Rust base building. If that sounds good to you, you’ll love it.Gameplay: Palworld plays like a mixture of Pokémon: Legends Arceus (PLA from now on) and ARK. You’re tossed in the deep end, given a tutorial series of quests, and left to figure it out. It’s fantastic. The typing pentagon with a weird sub pentagon for effective matchups is a bit disorganized, though.Dodges flow great, the guns feel ok, the pals can be a bit wonky in combat, and the latency on dedicated servers is often abysmal at the moment. Pals launching attacks mid capture, hitting through walls, or just jittering are also problems you will encounter. As far as early access goes, extremely solid core gameplay loop.8/10Characters: If you are not interested in learning about them, you can 100% ignore any and all human NPCs. Highly stylized bosses and a great variety of pals do give the game’s character a chance to shine through. Whether it’s chittlet jumping when you jump or a toco firing explosive eggs, the game itself does not lack character at all. Humans though? Not great.5/10Story: Explained through journal pages you find scattered across the world, the story is very ARK styled in its approach to exposition and delivery. If you want to find it, you can. Without getting too heavy into the spoilers, you are a time traveler.7.5/10, good lore reads.Sound: soundtrack slaps, doesn’t get in the way, boss themes are great. Sound effects are good too, if a bit jarring at times. Hearing 30 hit marker sound effects from a digtoise is funny at first, then very grating.Attacks sound good enough, guns sound punchy and sharp, the reload is deafening though.7/10, needs more brassBugs: Extremely buggy, prone to server crashes frequently, and many INI settings adjustments do nothing (max pals at base, max base size, etc). They are rapidly fixing bugs though. They fixed map clipping insanely fast compared to ARK where it is still a huge problem.4/10, can get annoying and game breaking.Overall Score: the game “as is” is a 7/10. If/when it is finished with endgame raids, pal arenas, pvp, etc. I expect it to be higher, potentially 9/10. Mods will also bear massively in this games future.;Recommended;1980;49.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is a great experience as a single player game. I have yet to play online and I am waiting for PvP. Paid full price, game seems worth 20 hours in. I don't believe it is a Pokemon knockoff because it takes the best out of a lot of games and tries to make it their ownGame has little warmth to it. It feels almost a little COD like in the sense that you'll be desensitized to killing the little creatures;Recommended;326;21.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Been Fun for me solo so far so yea I haven't played with others but games pretty awesome would say give it a shot for sure solo! You can try multiplayer if you like but at the moment of this post they are still having some save issue stuff with guilds and data of players being lost them losing pals and levels and stuff? If host isn't on when they get on they can't get on or make progress kind of stuff? Something of that sort Which is being worked on it seems I suppose they plan to make level and pal progression saves transferable too any server you go too perhaps but IDK.Overall games lots of fun too just chill, or grind on if that is your thing If you make your own server you can make the settings fit your play style. Make things pretty easy or really hard so its pretty cool you can even change the settings at any time and it will update I got a bit tired of the raids so got rid of them after grinding too level 20+ the first day of playing. Later I got tired of the exp grind so boosted it for myself too just roam more freely and check everything out. Already got all the pals now after a few days grinding too catch them all and breed some of them. I can replay too make it more challenging next time if I want or just continue where I am building wild stuff for myself and grinding to get super pals or something if I want I guess.You can make eggs take forever too hatch, or pop them instantly! Feels so awesome to be able to just pop them at any time, you still need too hold F for a short while on the incubator too actually hatch them after the instant pop, but yea still instantly hatch-able eggs without the timer!!! Is so nice if you want too offload a load of eggs without making a ton of incubators too do so, or wait forever on them... or build like a chest just too hold dozens or more eggs while you go off roaming and exploring and forgetting to go back home too hatch and slap in the next egg in! LOL. The stamina thing is a bit annoying at times as well but can be adjusted as well so can hunger which is great to be able too do. You can add more mobility freedom or toughen things up a bit too feel pressured if you want. Note Pal and your stamina and food have own sliders so make sure too tick them both up or down too the levels you want. You can mess with day and night time frames as well as attack damage and pal damage too a degree as well. All that makes it so easy too make the game more enjoyable too different types of play styles. Adjustable settings aside the game play is fun as well with the dodge rolls and aiming pretty easy to learn for me at least I enjoy the mobility of my character overall. The gliding and flying is fun and the world is massive and beautiful too just look at and admire the scenery of the game at least for me I would give it all a 10/10 for fun and good times!Even with the few bugs I encountered with clipping thing or myself through a wall haha! Honestly that actually kind of made things more fun cause it was funny other than the time I clipped a pal I wanted too catch through a mine shaft cave rooftop and it got stuck in it! I was riding my pal using the rockets and they cause it to be yeeted up through the ceiling/roof of the cave/mine shaft. So anyways I couldn't catch it and had too force its re-spawn! By moving far away from it the hp would just reset back too its starting point and the pal would reset too its starting location also, then just repeat the beating it down process and hope not too yeet/derp it again or kill it. Finally was eventually able to catch it after a few derps of killing it or the 1 time mention where it got yeeted lol! Found it funny after the frustration passed and honestly kind of during the frustration I was laughing cause it was stuck firing shots randomly at me through the wall above me with like 63 hp left I couldn't seem too kill it even though it seemed I was able too hit it or so I thought but it lost no hp when stuck there. Why I left and just reset it cause was pretty sure I wouldn't be able to get a pal sphere too connect with it through the ceiling/roof wall. I also had a certain speedy legendary pal Jetragon yeet me into the air when I was standing on a rock a few times as well! I would fly so far away that it would reset its hp! I had too start over from scratch fighting it a few times as well learning the lesson careful not too stand on certain areas or you can be yeeted away pretty high and far took a moment too safely glide back haha. I had a few funny moments of goofy stuff happen to me that just made me love my journey through Palworld all the more! It was enjoyable so far and plan too keep playing it for a very long time!Looking forward too hopefully seeing some more new pals and hopefully a larger pal box container too go with it in the future updates! Though for real need a much larger pal box if your gonna make crazy high requirement numbers too fuse pals into another pal to make that single pal stronger. It started out fine with just 4 for the first star boost but skyrockets into crazy numbers fast of I think it was for the second star 16?... followed by like 32 or so I think then into the 100's or something like that? Or was 32 not even in it 36 maybe? IDK! I haven't really bothered messing with that enough too recall it. Didn't feel a need really I just captured all the pals in the game and said that is good enough for me now I can just base build and chill looking around and stuff. Goofing off doing whatever I feel like challenge myself with using different settings and things over time doing whatever I please that the game will allow me to do! Play it love it and enjoy it!Ps. Sorry this was so long and wordy but had a bit too say! Also word too the Devs if your reading this at any point can you make diving a part of the game too go underwater and possibly do battle and grab items that may have sunk into the depths of currently swimming only water? That or make the items float at least I think I lost a few drops too the depths here and there some from mobs and 1 time from a chest on a hill above water cause my inventory was full something slid down the rocky hill mound into the water just out of reach since it was swimming level. Least I think it was out of reach can't recall for certain didn't bother too try grabbing it honestly I don't think? Nothing major really but a minor annoyance pretty sure when killing them above water items just sank into the depths out of reach but not sure on it 100% maybe you could still fly or swim out and grab them? Uncertain since I didn't really try going after all the drops.Anyways enough rambling loved the game and gonna keep playing over time! Hope everybody else enjoys it as well!;Recommended;5397;102.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;WOW. This game is phenomenal, and it's only EARLY ACCESS. The devs are awesome, quick to fix anything that comes about.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun and addicting game it has some bugs in it being early access but non particularly game breaking or bad and after 254 hours of play I would have to say you get your moneys worth in buying the game. Its half the price of pokemon with double the content its like they played legends arceus and were like this is a nice step but we can do better and its worlds better than scarlet and violet it has elements of ark and breath of the wild as well added in. Warning this game will not make you suddenly like survival games if you hate them theres still plenty of farming for the player to do but the pals do make it easier.;Recommended;499;265.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I really enjoy this game. I love building games, survival and crafting games, collecting style games, bosses and dungeons, exploring worlds, and playing with others. This game combines all of that and has cute characters with guns! Oh, and breeding and hatching, that’s fun to me, too. Is it a perfect game? No, it’s early access. As a lover of building, that’s a bit janky and drives me batty, but I still figure it out, work with it, and create some cool bases. The pathing with the pals drives me insane, but I laugh as I chase them around, trying to pick them up and throw them elsewhere. It’s challenging but not overly complicated. It has a grind, but it’s not the type of grind that is like a 9 to 5. I feel the progression, resource needs to craft, and fighting is all at the right speed for me. I hope they continue to improve the AI for the pals and their pathing within the base. I hope they update the building mechanics like foundations should snap to a floor or vs. versa, to maintain the grid for support and keep the structure on one grid vs. trying to place one perfectly to have a seamless look. Rails, I would love some rails and a few more variants in options for building. Overall, I still love the game, have a blast with my friends on our server, and recommend the game.;Recommended;1052;170.3;

As a lover of building, that’s a bit janky and drives me batty, but I still figure it out, work with it, and create some cool bases. The pathing with the pals drives me insane, but I laugh as I chase them around, trying to pick them up and throw them elsewhere. It’s challenging but not overly complicated. It has a grind, but it’s not the type of grind that is like a 9 to 5. I feel the progression, resource needs to craft, and fighting is all at the right speed for me. I hope they continue to improve the AI for the pals and their pathing within the base. I hope they update the building mechanics like foundations should snap to a floor or vs. versa, to maintain the grid for support and keep the structure on one grid vs. trying to place one perfectly to have a seamless look. Rails, I would love some rails and a few more variants in options for building. Overall, I still love the game, have a blast with my friends on our server, and recommend the game.;Recommended;1052;170.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has so many great things to offer. And to top it off, you can customize quite some settings to make it into a suitable experience, the way you like it to be!I have not come across any game breaking glitches or bugs. There are still things needed and in need of optimization. Such as the ai of the Pals, better building mechanics, some item to allow for the Pals work distribution. Just from the top of my head.Also, some server settings can be change but not all of them work which makes it stay as default on the server. Such as the amount of Pals per base.It would be great to see a server setting to allow for more bases per guild.But all in all a great game and I am having a blast playing this on my own and on my families own dedicated server (which runs great without issues btw.).;Recommended;645;88.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;If you're dumb enough to enjoy Ark in the state it has remained in for half a decade, this game will open your eyes to what Wildcard could have done with the tiniest bit of effort or care. Palworld is a masterclass in caring about the details and building something meaningful. And that is communicated through the limited experience offered in Early Access. The framework here gives me high hopes for the struggle ahead. Not something i have had in survival game in a fortnite™. Congrats to you devs.;Recommended;413;110.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ive had this game for 12 days and have 122 hours in the game and the game play has not slowed down at all. It is still as fun and engaging as it was when I first played.

If you are new to gaming this will be the perfect game to get you into the scene with its great community and very intuitive and easy to understand game play.;Recommended;304;126.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Its Ark, but with Pokemon---and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing so far. Its in alpha rn so there are bugs for sure, but overall the general experience is extremely rewarding and easy to want to come back to to catch one more pal or beat one more boss. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys survival games with a fun twist of cute little companions you get to have out on your base working and helping out. Even if you aren't the type to be into survival, I would give this game a shot (if you have the means). If you bore with building, but love breeding-grab a buddy who will build you mansions as you create an army of pals to bring to the bosses.Only con--no sex. YET;Recommended;538;45.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Beyond impressive for being in an ""experimental"" state, or at least multiplayer.At the very moment there is a bug related to weapon items being deleted from your hands, via pal spheres overwriting them when throwing or some other unknown reason.I've only found 3-4 misplaced terrain items, and ive wandered around the island for hours and still have half the island to go. I've sat in base, simultaneously progressing pals and material gain whilst fiddling with the base's layout and looks. I'm impressed by some of the mechanics. Pal AI and sometimes animation is buggy.";Recommended;478;55.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's just Ark. An far easier form of Ark but still Ark. I wouldn't recommend Ark to anyone and the same reasoning follows to this. IMO, grinding resources is not game play.;Not Recommended;141;4.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld's core game-play loop is absolutely fantastic.Third person shooter combat with summons to acquire better summons and improve yourself and the summons you have acquired.However all of its ancillary systems are profoundly poorly implemented.Its building system is one of the worst I have experienced out of all of the open world survival games I have played.Controls are cumbersome. I can't count how many balls I have thrown at the ground. The lag of trying to mount or dismount in combat and recall a pal before it gets nuked. The inability to dodge when mounted. Randomly dismounting when trying to gather resources. It has a myriad of quality of life issues.The UI is a cluster ♥♥♥♥. In game tooltips are useless. Information is spread across a range of different UI sub layers or completely absent.Base NPC AI is abysmal.All of that said it is one of the most fun games I have played this year. I sincerely hope they can get a handle on all of the issues it has, because it has so much potential to be one of the best games. But I worry that this relatively new and small studio doesn't have the resources or experience necessary to turn this game into what it deserves.;Recommended;976;34.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Extremely glitchy and lacking polish, and while thats to be expected of an early access game, it still impacts the experience quite severely, and the majority of these glitches leave me wondering if the game has had any testing before being released. The game is extremely grindy, and very solo unfriendly, with raids and bosses randomly taking 20x less damage than their wild counterparts, and crafting everything being an absolute chore. You will have to spend ridiculous lengths of time crafting for so many things. To get a tolerable experience, you will have to take advantage of the games world customisation options, removing death penalties and increasing loot drops so you can farm resources at a massively increased speed, and then just respawn to get those resources back to base, as the weight carry limit is absurdly restrictive for a game that requires so much resource farming.The world, while large, is also largely empty, and quite repetitive. You will quickly notice the lazy asset usage, with the NPCs and their settlements looking very out of place. The buildings are disjointed, completely unfurnished and uninhabited, and frequently not even connected to the floor, or with terrain and trees clipping through them. Few places have unique pal spawns, and many areas are just vast expanses of nothing. You could almost certainly get every pal in the game without exploring 75% of the world.The story is non existent, leaving me questioning why we're doing any of this. We have to go to these towers to battle these bosses, but why are we doing that? They aren't bothering me, why is it my goal to fight them? Some areas of the world are restricted and guarded, but why? Who are these guards? Why are they here? The game gives a tutorial about crime and law, yet the only crime even possible is visiting these places, which doesn't even make sense to be a crime. Idk, there's just a lot which either doesn't make sense, or isn't well explained.As for the good: The game gives you so damn much freedom. You do whatever you want whenever you want however you want. You get the ability to ride on flying pals at some point, and that's that, you can now just fly across the entire world however you please. There are no restrictions, which I absolutely love.The pals are all so wonderfully designed. While many of them are uninspired pokemon clones, this game actually understands what makes pokemon designs good. Many games like this fall short here, not capturing what makes pokemon so lovely, but this game nails it. It has a very wide array of pals, ranging from small stupid and cute, to giant, strong, and monstrous. That perfectly executed diversity makes this game have the best creature design of any pokemon inspired game imo.The pals all feel quite real too. They all behave differently, are well animated, have unique moves, and do different things. If it weren't for the same pals being in so many different locations, this could feel like such a perfect ecosystem where every creature serves it's own individual role. I hope as the game expands that it reaches that point.Overall, the game is great fun with so much good things going for it, but i definitely think it's overhyped. It has all the same bugs pokemon has and more, is very poorly made, and has some poor design choices. However, many of the issues are managable due to the very extensive world options menu, and I imagine many (if not all) of the bugs will be tackled as the game is developed. The game has so much potential and i'm very excited to see it develop, but as it is right now, it's still got a long way to go.;Recommended;2984;66.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld's play style is similar to a blend of several of my favorite games. The Pals are the centerpiece but building, exploring, and crafting are really well built-out already. The map feels huge with lots of places to explore. Building system is good - still some room for improvement with more snap options and building parts. The scale of base components works really well. There's a ton of stuff to craft. Weapons, Armor, Support pieces, Ammo, helpful Key Items, and recipes you can find to make higher quality pieces. Surprising depth and really solid on single-player. Some memory leaks affect multi-player right now, but it's bearable. Surprisingly good quality for early access.;Recommended;577;171.5;

There's a ton of stuff to craft. Weapons, Armor, Support pieces, Ammo, helpful Key Items, and recipes you can find to make higher quality pieces. Surprising depth and really solid on single-player. Some memory leaks affect multi-player right now, but it's bearable. Surprisingly good quality for early access.;Recommended;577;171.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;solid gameplay loop, a lot to do and its only early accesshaven't had any serious bugs either, only complaint is that the survival genre can get a little boring after a while but that's more on me i thinki've played far too many survival games, but for this price this game is worth every penny;Recommended;240;7.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun game :) hope more stuff will be added in the near future I've already ran out of stuff to do on the map, completed my paldeck, done the boss fights and the multiple caves around the map aren't really worth exploring the cave layout is a bit different in each region but all the caves within those regions are pretty much all the same so it's kind of pointless exploring all the caves around the map. Hoping for the future they'll add more pals, more maps and more activities to do around the map, would be nice if the base area with the palbox could be expanded aswell I don't like how big the base is having all those pals and builds in such a small area is kind of annoying and sometimes my pals glitch out of the base radius and then can't get back in. I know the game is still in early access but it has so much potential looking forward to the future updates will be back to play the game whenever a big update drops :);Recommended;747;46.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game has been an enjoyable experience from the moment I got chased down and murdered by a creature I had no business fighting. Just reading 3rd party reviews and seeing the lamentation of people regarding brutality and exploitation don't seem to have picked up the game and played it. The longer that I play the more I realize that it's a cooperative relationship between the player and the pals for survival on an island where the food chain makes no sense.;Recommended;378;13.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I have just come over from the Xbox version, just to play on dedicated servers with others. I haven't played a PC game since 2010 when League of Legends' 1st year out, so to get a hardcore console player to switch just for this specific game, well done.;Recommended;206;13.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"24 hours: I'm shocked that a Pokemon rip-off turned open-world-survival-craft with guns has gone viral. That's called sarcasm.Hey, do what you do I don't really care. The game itself has potential. There's already not enough pokemon ERR I MEAN PALS and the progressive crafting system is over-done. Minecraft was cool because you could skip crap you didn't care about if you knew what you were doing, but I forgot you're not trying to rip off minecraft, MY BAD.As far as the AI goes though, whoever you got coding the Pokemon AI; you should probably fire. They are absolutely mind-numbingly moronic. So moronic that it doesn't bother me that there's a guy in the world who's presumably torturing and murdering Pokemon by the dozens.And to the general public: THIS is what you've shot to the top of the charts? THIS??? When I say ""You are..."", you say ""down bad!"" Do better.1: Pal AI: Expect pathing issues, expect them to drop items in the middle of transporting them to do something else, expect them to try to operate stations out of reach despite a clear path being given to them, expect them to hate anything indoors, expect them to glitch out themselves and stations.2: Open-World: No seed generation so I guess it's great for speed running?3: Loot sucks; they make this big hubbub about Pokemon with guns but let's be real, only a few of them can have guns which aren't your typical gear; but rather something you unlock via crafting... and the guns you can craft (not loot) are way down the progression line and ultimately I can't see there being much a point SINCE YOU HAVE A GANG OF POKEMON AT YOUR BECK AND CALL.4: Ohhh you can capture bad guys and enslave them! Who cares. They offer nothing worthwhile for such a low success rate. Enjoy your slave camp though, kid.5: What is wrong with coolers? Aside from pathing constantly seeming to be an issue with these, I can't tell if they're going to work or not. The timers inside fluctuate about as much as people's stance on stolen content, and transferring food from one inventory to another resets the timers anyways so...why cooler? I haven't gotten to anything electric yet, but I bet it'll be the same mess.6: Structures suck, placing them anywhere outside of flat ground will have em leaning sideways. Building system is lackluster in comparison to basically every other survival craft on the market.7: Multiplayer is party-based. I was expecting this to be as popular as it is because everyone was online shooting pals with rare and unique items together...nope, it's literally popular because it's a pokemon ripoff and the gaming community is so tragically debased that that alone pushes this title to the top.8: Aside from the aforementioned issues; it's rife with bugs, quality of life issues, optimization issues, and a purposeful direction. Whatever story there is supposed to be here is made into a mockery by a lifeless world. Little to no voice acting, Pals in the open world feel like soulless entities only there for you to murder or enslave. The enemies are pathetically unimportant to whatever importance is trying to be established here; they're basically just business rivals because you're nowhere a hero in this game, you're a profiteer of poaching, animal abuse, and enslavement.Again I don't care that its a blatant ripoff. I don't care that you can be a villain without a story. I care about whether the game is good or not; and it's not. Not right now at least, and due to the specific way it's been designed; it will never be the greatest version of itself it could be:You aren't getting rare and unique itemsYou aren't exploring unique and endless worldsYou aren't building the coolest bases everYou aren't experiencing the most immersive combat systemsYou're not uncovering the craziest secrets and loreYou're aren't pushing yourself to the limits with the most challenging survival gameplayEverything it's attempting it comes up short on.Everyone else can fall for the hype train and gaslight this game into their personal favorites but I'm not with stupid.What this game does well:1:You can climb basically anything. A much needed feature for open-world games.2:You can collect and ""train"" pals. (Not much training involved) and they do stuff around your base making your life easier. It's a comforting mashup of creature collector/colony sim/automation that more games should approach.3: Basing up is easy and seemingly limitless. More games need to approach ""camp-building"" rather than ""base-building""; and this dips it's toes into that water. (unfortunately without much purpose)4: Settings Customization: You can play this game pretty much however you want thanks to an in-depth list of gameplay settings. I've rated this based off the default settings, and I don't really think changing these settings would completely change the way the game works and that's the biggest problem with the game for me personally.5: I assume they've allowed modding; that's great and most studios should thank modders for adding and fixing things in their games free of charge; HOWEVER that is by no means an excuse to push out a product with the intent of relying on mods to fix the issues the devs didn't, and I personally try to stay away from mods.

And once you have the basics down at your base, you can just run off and explore if you want. It's dangerous, but fun to look around.Overall, very addictive format, enjoyable game loop, and the pals add fun variety to an otherwise fairly standard survival experience. 20 hours in so far and the world is bigger than I expected, looking forward to continuing to expand my base and catch stronger pals.";Recommended;635;24.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;So... having played Craftopia, I knew I'd feel at home in this game. The fear I had however was: would the devs be able to focus the game and remove the complexity sprawl (attribute hell) and lack of direction (many game systems smashed together) Craftopia is plagued by?... and I have been happily surprised by what feels like a focused and refined game. Including a crafting experience that feels like they have learned and made important decisions about what is and isn't important, and throw on top of that some unique and cute poke...able pals.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Everyone knows what ""Pals"" really are, so let's not beat around the bush here. That's not my concern, or the reason for my overall impression of the game. You see, unlike a lot of people I squeaked by just over the age range for Pokemon. In my 20's they had no appeal to me, so I just ignored them.Now I find myself playing a game ""inspired by"" Pokemon. Okay, so let's do this then.This is a survival sandbox game the people often compare to Ark and Rust. I would, however, compare it closer to Subnautica and WoW. The combat feels very WoW-ish, while the landscape appears like an overworld Subnautica and is a static map.Like a lot of these survival games, though, in Palworld the player hits a wall very quickly.The tedious nature of base building sets in rather quickly.You have limited space to plan for more and more and more and more items that you keep needing to unlock in order to ""level up"" your base to give you more things to build... in this ever shrinking space to build in. If you have the slightest bit of OCD, you're going to be pulling your hair out as you unlock more and more base pieces you have to make room for somehow. To add to this, not every potential upgrade is visible on the list, so you have to hope you don't get hit with any more surprise buildings along the way!This is where it feels like World of Warcraft in all the wrong ways. Though you take a more active role in your attacks, your swings and impacts don't actually feel like they hit or do anything. I usually have to check numbers and health bars to make sure I'm getting hits. The combat Pals you can call in just do their own things and are sometimes helpful, other times useless.The combat does the job, but don't expect a Dark Souls experience, or even a Skyrim experience here.There are two ways to level in the game - through crafting and combat/capturing. I mentioned how some of the crafting works though and the rest is just grinding supplies out at the standard workbench every survival game has. if you want a break from that system, you're left with combat. I also mentioned the combat, so now you get to choose between the lesser evil.I was excited to capture them at first and find new ones, but then I saw those same ones just strolling aimlessly through an open plains, then I saw the next cool one, walking as a pack through a forest. The Pals don't have a life outside of being captured and feel like braindead zombies. On top of that, they aren't as rare as they seem and the novelty of finding a new one wears thin after the first 2 times you spot them.Then your spheres... aim them just right or one pixel off will have you launch them into the void where you will never get them back. That is...... if you remembered to take them?The other part of crafting consumables is that you need to go through one tiny little step most games don't have you do. You have to actually ""acquire"" them from the crafting station. Those 20 eggs you cooked mean nothing if you left them roasting on your campfire while you went out exploring. Those 30 arrows won't do any good sitting on your crafting station either. Oh! And if you thought you'd go hunt and trap some Pals, I guess you won't be since you just left your 2 dozen spheres on the workbench!There's no need for this mechanic to exist in the game, yet here it is.Don't let the peer pressure from friends, streamers, or Youtubers push you into playing this game, or stop you from refunding if that first hour doesn't feel satisfying. I don't see them fixing most of the core issues I mentioned here since the game is designed around them, so if any of those things sound off-putting, you have a good idea of what direction the game will be going!";Not Recommended;3019;4.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I'm a 69 year old single father of a 420 year old son, and he found an old floppy disk of this game at the house. We installed it and played it together and it has saved our relationship. Upvote my garbage copypasta like you upvote all the others.;Recommended;199;9.3;

No, Pal-world. chop them up, shoot them, torture them, make them work for you because why should you when you have someone who has no other choice than to do it for you. is your pal misbehaving?

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Zelda+ark+pokemon rip-off 100% lol;Recommended;31;16.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;As of writing this review, I just finished the game with catching every Pal and beating every boss, as well as getting every achievement. I did this on a solo server with normal exp gain and no other modifiers set, so keep that in mind as my experience in this review may be different from yours! I feel like I can give a decent PROS/CONS list though with a bit over 100hrs in the game.PROS:* Massive world, a ton to find and explore, with secrets, secret Pals, secret chests and collectibles, etc.* As of this review, there's 137 different Pals to find. Regardless of some of them being similar to Pokemon or not, they have fun designs and a lot of them mesh well with the areas you find them in (EX: a fire lion in the volcano biome, or a moss panda in the bamboo forest biome)* Combat feels very fun so far, and shooting things with the guns in the game feels very satisfying, and for the most part, scaling and damage is pretty fair and balanced* Building, while still needing polishing, is pretty fun and allows you to express your creativity (for the most part, which will be addressed below)CONS:* While damage you deal seems balanced for the most part, damage that enemies deal to you does not. At the end of the game, I was level 47 (max is level 50) with the best armor and shield in the game, and enemies that were 20 or so levels under me still depleted my whole shield in 1 or 2 hits. This definitely needs to be balanced, as I felt it to be a waste of resources to make the new tiers of armor at almost every level.* The AI of the Pals in your base is genuinely some of the worst I've ever seen in any game. You will spend so so much time just trying to get your Pals to build or craft the correct thing, they walk through walls of your base and somehow cant get back inside your base, so they end up fainting thus requiring you to wait to heal them or spend resources to heal them. They don't do tasks that they are good in, opting for the tasks they're poor in, leading them to walk back and forth between 2 points in your base just to do nothing. There NEEDS to be a system in place to delegate tasks to your Pals in the base, so hopefully this gets added ASAP.THINGS I WANT TO SEE CHANGE* Hopefully they add more to the world to do, more Pals to find, more locations or enemy bases to find and fight, more open spaces to build in, just more things to be able to do. They say they're planning on doing this, and they seem to have delivered on the updates so far, so hopefully they actually add stuff and not just a Pal or weapon here and there* Pal AI fixes need to happen ASAP. At the end of the game it got so bad and annoying to the point of me not interacting with my Pals at the base anymore due to them just not listening, walking away after forcing them to do tasks by throwing them on a workbench in the correct angle for 10 minutes, or even putting items in the incorrect chest 50 feet away from the closer chest with the item stack already inside of it. This is my biggest gripe so far.* Combat balancing in regards to the amount of damage you receive, and actually making it feel worthwhile to build new items and armor. Typing needs to be implemented with ineffective types, because now there's only effective moves with Pal typing (EX: water type does extra damage to fire type, while fire does normal damage to water type, not less damage like you would expect)Overall, just under $30 for 100hrs of mostly fun (and the ability to play with up to 30 something friends online), and the fact you piss off Pokemon fans just by playing it, seems like a pretty good deal to me.;Recommended;2913;109.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Day 1 of Palworld has been completed... I lost track of time... The exploration is endless, the grind is real, don't turn up the difficulty to the max if you are not familiar with the mechanics. Capture everything you see... literally Gotta Catch em All....The game reminds me of a Larger exploration of LoZ: BotW, Capturing your Pal is like any other pocket monster game. The building is a tad wonky and only issue I truly have with the game so far, other than getting stuck in walls or rocks.100% recommend. Glad to see another non AAA game blowing up.;Recommended;455;21.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I wanted to like it. But the glaring issues and complete oversight from the developers has made this unplayable from a multiplayer standpoint. Stay far far away from multiplayer servers, they released this heap of garbage with EXTREME security vulnerabilities. Cracked clients and cheat mods have destroyed community servers and forced server owners to have to completely lock down their servers. There is ZERO anticheat with this game. Here's the best part though, cheat mods are able to take over admin of servers, delete bases, corrupt player saves, shutdown servers and may even soon have the ability to REC on servers.As far as the gameplay goes, extremely repetitive. The ui is clunky and unintuitive. You randomly fall through the map or get stuck under the map with no way of getting out.Cannot say that I would recommend this game to anyone in its current form, and quite fankly, probably never would. This is a poorly organized UE5 Asset store conglomeration that attempts to capitalize on the pokemon craze. This never should have been released as a multiplayer game in it state.;Not Recommended;910;2.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Well. Here I am, playing a game I didn't want to like. I didn't even buy it, my husband (the most frugal guy I know) bought it for me because he wanted, no NEEDED me to experience it. My friends were about ready to hold an intervention to force me into it. Now the problem is, they can't get me to STOP playing it.My biggest criticisms from the start were the same as everyone else's: the ""Pals"" look a lot like certain other popular creatures, hastily slapped together. They look awfully familiar, don't they? You capture them in balls and make them fight. We've seen this before.But THAT is where the similarities end. This game may be 5 other games in a trenchcoat, but HOLY MOTHER OF HECK did they do a fine job in making a game that's WAY more fun and addictive than any other game you could compare it to. THIS is what these big companies should have given us a decade ago. They could, but they didn't, because the big bois in the bidness know that this level of effort isn't necessary to get your cash.I will always hold a lot of love in my heart for Pokeymang and any other game you could liken this to, that won't change. But this game is just plain better. SO much better in every way I can think of. This is the game we deserve, and I can't wait to play more.";Recommended;1027;59.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is basically Ark/ Pokemon without needing 400GB and having more innovate game mechanics , I can see this game going far with how well it sold and cross play being on the Road Map is a big plus!;Recommended;164;48.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is now my favorite game. I haven't enjoyed the early stages of a game this much since Minecraft Alpha. Also, the reddit soy poke-seethe is a nice bonus;Recommended;128;45.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Even in its early access state, there is a lot of fun to be had and a surprisingly robust endgame experience. I am looking forward to future updates and hopefully DLC content.;Recommended;144;129.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;As much as a meme as this game has become, it's actually better than what you've heard. Honestly. And this is the worst it'll ever be -- that is to say that they're constantly making improvements to the game. It's only going to get better from here, and it's already great! I honestly would've felt like I had gotten good value for my money if this game were $50, instead of just $30. In a year, I'd have happily paid $60, if they continue making the improvements that they're already doing now. 8/10, great game so far!!;Recommended;425;16.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Pretty good - 50 hours of coop gameplay.Gets very grindy towards the end, but they allow you to tweak the game settings if that's not your thing.Also FYI dont waste points upgrading Pals until you get a level 50 legendary (Jetragon / Frostallion / Paladius / Necromus) as you are wasting the extremely limited points.;Recommended;263;53.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Even ignoring the Pokemon aesthetics of the Pal's this game has a good core loop with Exploration, Base Building and Pal Collecting.I've gotten over 150 hours out of the the game before I felt like I ran out of fun to be had with the content in the game, and given that this is week 2 of early access I'm sure I'll be back once some more content comes out.To note, there are many bugs, multiplayer especially has even more. Nothing game breaking happened but many small annoying things that do sap the enjoyment.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"As a lifetime-obsessed Pokemon fan since 1994, this is my MOST favorite mon-like to come out in the past few years.I've played over 50 hours since launch. Game has very high highs and very low lows! The feeling of opening this game for the first time is incredibly exciting and gets you hyped to play all day long. There does come a point where you feel the grind and things slow down, but overall I think the pacing for unlocking new tech and automation is alright. There is a nice balance between building up your base and exploration.The worst time I've had in this game was when my entire wooden base caught fire and burned EVERYTHING down, I was crestfallen and completely lost the will to play (hopefully I'll be back soon :') ). I'm hoping they will use this early access development period to expand on the storage system, making it easier to organize materials and transfer them between bases. I did not have a good time spending an entire hour+ picking up the broken remnants of my base and puttering them into tiny crafted chests with my character's lowly carry weigh. I personally think the base destruction mechanics and storage system to be unfun. (Granted, I am more of a basebuilder type player, so I like keeping tidy and decorating permanent fixtures)It runs very smoothly; even in multiplayer, my friends and I have experienced reasonably few dropped frames (some of the later game areas can get ever so slightly choppy, but it's not a game breaker).The monster designs leave much to be desired. It feels like 50% of the monsters are ""Eevee"", 10% are ""Dragonite"", and some monsters look so similar to each other they feel completely redundant (Petallia and Lyleen are the same creature to me). I'm less trying to say they are complete ripoffs of Pokemon and more that I just wish there was more variety (maybe cull some of the foxes, my goodness foxes are an invasive species in this world!). I think people would be super excited to get some new Pals down the line!The world is fun to explore as is, but I hope we also see some new additions (like world events or something) to help keep the world and exploration feeling fresh!Highly recommend this game. There's a reason copies of this are selling like hotcakes, and it's not just because it's a funny meme (though it *is* a funny meme, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that!).";Recommended;1945;50.5;

And I was prepared to deal with that for this unique experience. But the truth is, it feels, looks and plays like a AAA game. I was not expecting to have this much fun. I've spent my first 5 hours of the game just catching as many ""pals"" as I can, going back to base and putting them to work, making upgrades to my base, and then rinsing and repeating. And I simply can't get enough. I haven't even pursued the first boss yet because I'm addicted to this gameplay loop I've started. I can tell I'm gonna get a lot more than my money's worth.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"""Pokemon but with guns.""It's... no lie, but the statement falls criminally short of everything this game offers. For a game that is still incomplete there is an incredible amount of content to sink your teeth into and the degree of polish is pretty damned impressive.Regarding the polish - yes, there ARE bugs - but the worst bug I encountered clipped me through the ground and I had to do a quick restart to fix it. That's not a complaint. Literally, quit to main menu, go back in. 15 seconds, done. Fixed. And lost nothing in the process. While not perfect, it puts most triple-A titles to shame.As for the content.... The most obvious is collecting the pals, which is more important than one might expect as it's the best way to gain experience and having extras on hand will be important for maintaining and defending your base which is a HUGE help with resource collection.Speaking of bases, there's that. As you level up you'll unlock more functions to your base, be able to build it out of different materials, and it's entirely customizable - a simple hovel or a towering fortress, create it how you please. Admittedly, tile placement can be a little wonky - with roof tiles wanting to connect to floor tiles more easily than the tops of walls - still, it's not irredeemably bad.Naturally, there's combat as well, which is great. For weakening the pals in preparation to catch them you'll want to use melee with is notably weaker than ranged attacks - I'm not sure if that was intentional, but if you're higher level trying to catch weaker pals it is a priceless asset. Additionally, you have human enemies and fight them directly - seriously your base will occasionally get attacked by humans of the enemy factions and they are there to KILL you. So none of that ""blacked out"" or ""fainting"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. While the game is obviously not geared towards kids, it's inspiration doesn't seem to realize that it's main audience have grown up and are adults now. It's nice to have a game that doesn't condescend with thinly veiled double-speak.Lastly is crafting, it's easy if not the quickest - all the resources you have on based are considered in your inventory, so you don't have to worry about pulling things out of chests to build... whatever. It's a very nice QoL choice on the part of the devs.Now, what could be done better? A lot. There are still things that it's faster/easier to farm offsite, which isn't a bad thing in its own right, but moving while over your carry weight is annoyingly slow. I get the /why/ but but ""realism"" shouldn't take precedence over fun; now I wouldn't ask that it be completely removed, but having one of your pals on standby with a cart that'll haul things between wherever you are and your base, or the larger ride-able pals being unaffected by however much you're carrying would be a godsend. Similarly, flying pals you can ride are really slow and the stamina use with it is extremely limiting. Lastly, apart from the obvious inspirations, there are a disturbing number of pals that are mere reskins of each other - which with less than 150, is pretty awful. I'd love to see to some of the reskinned beasts be flat-out replaced; and while I wouldn't want a thousand plus, another 50-100 would be nice.That all said, this game is still only ~60% complete and is damned good as it is; so I am VERY hopeful for the future of this game and wish it and the people creating this absolute gem nothing but the best.8.5/10, with the expectation I'll be bumping this to a 10 upon it's completion.";Recommended;2905;33.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"""Pokemon but with guns.""It's... no lie, but the statement falls criminally short of everything this game offers. For a game that is still incomplete there is an incredible amount of content to sink your teeth into and the degree of polish is pretty damned impressive.Regarding the polish - yes, there ARE bugs - but the worst bug I encountered clipped me through the ground and I had to do a quick restart to fix it. That's not a complaint. Literally, quit to main menu, go back in. 15 seconds, done. Fixed. And lost nothing in the process. While not perfect, it puts most triple-A titles to shame.As for the content....

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"It's good, but it's a little confused as to who it's for which doesn't quite take you through to wanting to play it at the same level of say Valheim or something like that.The fact the world isn't based in procedural generation makes it a little ""paint by numbers"" in the sense of there are specific places where you should build a base for maximum efficiency. The base building is a little restrictive, but original. I feel that the Palbox needs a bigger range, rather than ""more of them"" as most people will stick to the one base. Fast travel makes things easy and the world looks beautiful, if not a little empty of life beyond the ""Pals"" themselves.The Pals are obviously based around Nintendo's designs. They're too close and obvious for them not to be, which means they're fun and engaging creatures. My issue comes with equipping them with guns or guns existing in the game. I know they're to entice the audience but the immersion breaks when you shoot a human in the head and they don't die. If you're using guns to shoot Pals, there should be some degree of damage - which brings me back to my first point, who is it for? Adults? Add blood or some damage mechanics. Kids? Why the guns? There's also an almighty slog to get to the stage where you have those weapons so it takes a while to get weapons that do as much damage as your Pals.Pal management is fun, I mean - my Pals eat Pancakes, sleep in a fluffy bed, do whatever they want and bathe in springs. I've managed to get to a decent level (26) without resorting to slave labour. I do think that again, it's a different audience than me that would enjoy being cruel to virtual animals.In all, it's a fun game. There's not much in the way of exploration where you can surprise your friends with anything new they won't have seen or heard of from others. The levelling system keeps you around to see what new items you can use. The Pal fighting is clunky but something I'm sure they'll improve.7/10 - good for about 20 hours before the novelty wears off.";Recommended;1645;28.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Incredibly fun game. Not for everyone as most survival crafting games aren't. Knowing this game is early access and I was able to play it for nearly 100 hours before hitting a burnout stage is really telling of it's quality. I can't wait to see what it'll be in a year or two from now.;Recommended;231;94.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;just a bunch of cheaters on every official server that destroy your base ruin your stats giving you -999999999 weight permanently ruining that server because you cant remake a different character forcing you to play single player where you only progress for leaving your pc on all day and night and ruining and ruining the experience meeting other players;Not Recommended;297;67.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Th e creatures are cute and as someone who likes mythological creatures like Pegasus, kirin, or the manticore, I really like the cooler looking creatures. The fighting is exciting and is tolerably difficult. The land itself is beautiful. I'm interested in seeing where the developers take the story (if they do) with the black market and any human bosses they introduce. The one in the desert particularly piqued my interest.**However, its the crafting that's a bore. Its dreary trying to craft things like the CAKE you need to BREED. They need to make the crafting of such important items ever-so-faster. Because even my husband who plays loses interest because of how long it takes to craft the better items. No joke, he stood there crafting a gun with a pal helping for five minutes. That's way too long in game times.;Recommended;681;165.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ok, so this game is what pushed me over the edge on getting a Steam deck.For an early access game it is so dang fun. Cannot wait to see what the finished product looks like. 8.9/10;Recommended;145;6.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;既然有了普通蛋，大蛋和巨大蛋，可不可以考虑加一个超小蛋！！不容易发现这样给人更惊喜的感觉，孵化出来可以参考魔兽里的小宠物，可以跟在人后面或者在人物模型上，没有战斗作用但是非常可爱；或者参考方舟里面类似水獭这种，可以围在人脖子上当围巾而且还能有扩重量或者战斗加成一些小的也不会影响平衡的功能性，真的需要更多可可爱爱的小东西！！！Since we have large and huge wild eggs already, it would be perfect to add an even more rare kind of egg which is much smaller in size than the common ones. As possible hatches, it could give player a small little pets (could refers to the non-battle companions in the world of Warcraft, which did nothing except follows the characters around, but which is really cute). Or it could hatch into a little pet which provides a non-battle utility (refers to the otter in the ARK, which can add a little weight bearing attributes, but the most important part is it can swirl around your neck as a scarf which is reeeeally cute).If the Devs could see this comment, please consider it sincerely!!!;Recommended;730;95.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Its early access so don't expect perfection. The loop and grind is really fun though, and keeps you wanting to level up yourself and your ... ahem... Pals. Base building is fun, but a bit janky. The Pals don't like to go straight to their tasks and tend to get hung up on stuff. Keep that in mind when building stuff you want help with. The abilities are insanely fun. Whether using Foxsparks as a flamethrower or Lifmunk as an Uzi, or flying around on a Galewing.Worth the buy.;Recommended;390;73.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Pokemon, the biggest gaming francise in history, and one of my favorite titles. SWSH, Arceus, and SV all sold really well. Why? Because modern Pokemon fans are starved for actually good games on the switch and will eat whatever Gamefreak ♥♥♥♥♥ out. Nothing against Nintendo. been a huge Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, and Metroid fan all my life. That includes Pokemon. In the least cringey way i can put it, i've been a Nintendo fan all of my life. i expect a lot of fun, not just quality from the games they make. ever since i first played Pokemon blue, I've been a fan. but as the years went on, the games never changed. they always stuck to the same formula. pick starter, train, battle, train, fight gym leaders, train, beat elite 4. it hadn't changed up until sun and moon on the 3ds, an appreciated change in direction, but overall game play was relatively the same, being such a small change. there was still that grind, training. you press the same move repeatedly and run into the same Pokemon repeatedly. it just got boring after so many years. Other Pokemon fans? they were fine with it. I would settle for it, because there wasn't another game doing anything similar. But then we got to the switch. Sword and shield was announced, and I was excited for the brand new title. ""it's a new Pokemon game! On the switch! Breath of the wild was so good, i'm sure this game is going to be great!"" i could not have been more wrong. the first trailer dropped. looked like ♥♥♥♥. ""It's an early trailer, im sure it'll get better"" time went on. more trailers dropping and still looking relatively the same. then came time for release. At that point, I had already decided not to pick up the game, at least until its issues were addressed. My brother did though. Pokemon fanatic (30 year old btw). Played the snot out of that game, as i watched. it was the worst Nintendo game I've ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes upon. frame rate, terrible. glitches, terrible. Gameplay? the same as its always been. no change. no innovation. nothing interesting. they even removed Pokemon. understandable, there were 1000 of them at that point, but i expect better. then we get to Arceus. The trailer dropped. and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, things are actually different. new gameplay mechanics, cool new art style. but the same issues from SWSH were still present. wasn't going to get this game either, but looked forward to the next title seeing as they were trying to take pokemon on in new direction. I was wrong. they weren't. SV comes out. Exactly the same as SWSH. at this point im done with Pokemon. Hated the state of Gamefreaks laziness and its effect on the series. Then i start hearing about Palworld online. At that point i had already heard of Palworld from my brother a year or two prior, showing me the first trailer ""it kinda looks like Pokemon, but with guns"" thought it was kinda interesting, but dismissed it because i was so disinterested with any even Pokemon related. Then it releases. Everyone starts freaking out about it. Heard great things about it, and some bad things (usually from Pokemon fanboys who were angry with the game). i decided to pick it up. and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, is the game fun. it's everything I loved about Pokemon, and other games. Elden ring? its got that. Breathe of the wild? got that too. Survival aspects? yes please! now the game is in early access, it's pretty glitchy, but its in early access and even in its current state, its only as glitchy as the most recent Pokemon title. It's super fun. after years of gamefreak just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on its fans because they know they're scat fetishists and will eat this ♥♥♥♥ up, this is what i was waiting for, this is what i wanted. actual change. Boring turn based combat? gone. you're actually involved in battles. Grinding, still kinda there but not nearly as annoying and you're involved with it. Survival? entirely new concept to a monster catcher that works suprisingly well. Your pals stay involved. whether it be with you or at your base, they're always doing something. they don't just sit in a box waiting to see the light of day. weapons and armor so you yourself can aid in battle, or just do it yourself. Don't get me wrong, the games not perfect, and i understand that gamefreak would never do something like this to their title because they need to be child friendly, but that doesn't mean they should stick to the same, uninteresting formula. this is innovation, maybe not at it's finest, but for someone who was so starved of anything good from Gamefreak, this is what i wanted.If you're a fan of Pokemon and you're tired of the games like i was, i highly suggest picking this game up. this game delivers so many interesting concepts and gameplay that even in its buggy early access state, even if this never changed, it's still worth the buy. I had my doubts from the drama, but you'll forget about it when playing the game.overall in its current state, id give this game a 7/10, purely because of the bugs. gameplay, 10/10. its a grab bag of everything good from a ton of series and somehow manages to make the perfect stew out of it all.";Recommended;4199;54.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun game sure, Ive put in many hours since release but its honestly getting super buggy, especially with the new update. Im constantly getting stuck on having my pal spheres out, the game randomly becomes choppy at times, base pals constantly getting stuck, along with other bugs.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is literally ARK Survival Breath of the Wild Pokemon. Game functions and mechanics of ARK, the exploration and world of BOTW, and the premise of Pokemon.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Survival monster collection game through and through. The game actually put those themes together very well and I expect them to not only push more content, but to also deepen the mechanics while at it. What I'm trying to say is that this is not just a collage of popular genres. It actually has more soul than the last pokemon games in my opinion.The pals are really well made, have personality and good well refined animations. I'm gonna tell you this, half of this game charm, when you actually play it, is that you get rizzed by the pals. They are really captivating. They even have idle behaviors that tells you about their nature and things like that if you pay close attention.Of course, the other half is the sheer insanity of the whole proposition. I got real good laughs at the jokes and the extent of what you can do in the game. You can fly on dragons and shoot enemies with an assault rifle, or better yet, you can shoot a penguin as a missile using a bazooka!But, I can only recommend this game to you if you are up to deal with early access junkness and broken things. But the way, it's not much, it was a surprisingly clean early access launch, yet not perfect, and sometimes updates can break things. Their focus now is to hammer down on the rough edges and bugs of the basic mechanics. This is their plan, launch in EA the game with the foundation done, polish it and build over it after that.So, if you are into the genre/idea and knows how to deal with an Ealy Access game, this game is a blast! Highly recommend it for monster collection fans.;Recommended;1275;22.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;full of hackers and laggy game play;Not Recommended;29;19.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I usually don't jump on hypetrains, but I wanted to try this and hell... I am an addict now.This is Valheim with catching weird animals. The map is huge and it's open world (lucky there are some fast travel spots). The farther you go, the better stats the animals types get. You need them for fighting to get even better animals or gather materials.You have to build a base (max is three by now I think) to craft stuff. You have to grind, work and kill for materials.There are field bosses, dungeon bosses, special bosses and 5 tower bosses (the strongest) all over the map. They are usually bigger and stronger variations of normal animals.All pals have different fighting and in camp abilities. So you always have to put your best team together. You can take 5 pals on your trips, but only one can be summoned at a time. Exceptions can be made with collars which allow some types to stay with you all the time (in addition to the summoned pal). If pals die, they don't vanish. Just put them in the camp's palbox and they get revived after 10 minutes.You can choose a restart point (mostly you camps) when you die. On easiest mode you don't lose stuff on death.It's early access, so there are some bugs, but I encountered nothing that a game reload couldn't fix so far.I am playing with controller, which I'd recommend.;Recommended;1082;47.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Putting the obvious aside that it's a great game consisting of Pokemon-like critters with guns, slavery, and human trafficking, this is the perfect game for adults who grew up with Pokemon. It provides several cute, cool, and intimidating pals as our childhood did, but making it an open-world, co-op survival game similar to Ark.;Recommended;277;38.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Late game is a slog. The pals pathing and AI is awful. The lack of task assignment kills the entire point of building a base for them to work at.You grind so much that you hardly get much play time past level 30 or so.;Not Recommended;174;32.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Combine the best parts of Ark, Minecraft, Breath of the Wild, Pokémon, and half a dozen other games, and this is what you get. Amazing game with super cool creatures to catch. I can only imagine Nintendo is crying in sheer frustration at how much better this game is than any of their recent Pokémon titles, and are probably upset that they can't do anything about it. I'm excited for their investigation to turn up nothing other than how inferior they are with their billions of dollars they haven't been spending on making their product better. :P;Recommended;453;27.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Better then pokemon will ever be;Recommended;27;91.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;so good it gave me blue balls;Recommended;23;126.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Putting the obvious aside that it's a great game consisting of Pokemon-like critters with guns, slavery, and human trafficking, this is the perfect game for adults who grew up with Pokemon. It provides several cute, cool, and intimidating pals as our childhood did, but making it an open-world, co-op survival game similar to Ark.;Recommended;277;38.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Late game is a slog. The pals pathing and AI is awful. The lack of task assignment kills the entire point of building a base for them to work at.You grind so much that you hardly get much play time past level 30 or so.;Not Recommended;174;32.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Combine the best parts of Ark, Minecraft, Breath of the Wild, Pokémon, and half a dozen other games, and this is what you get. Amazing game with super cool creatures to catch. I can only imagine Nintendo is crying in sheer frustration at how much better this game is than any of their recent Pokémon titles, and are probably upset that they can't do anything about it. I'm excited for their investigation to turn up nothing other than how inferior they are with their billions of dollars they haven't been spending on making their product better. :P;Recommended;453;27.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is strangely addictive. There is repetitiveness elements that should make me bored with the game, but I still start it and play it and then I realise I spent hours on it. Should you put the label pokemon with a gun on it? No. I am a pokemon fan, and this does not compare to it. There are a lot of bugs, but I haven't had a bug so bad it turned me off playing this game. Buy it, download it, enjoy it.;Recommended;327;83.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I didn't think my first play session was going to last 5.2 hours. I booted it up thinking the hype was probably a little over board and am delightedly wrong. There are rough spots but it is in Early Assess. All the core components of the game seem to work well and I am having a blast.;Recommended;229;7.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;In my 46.7 hours of playing, I wished we could breed human and pals together. Believe me, I tried to put a male mammorest and the girl at the starting area in a breeding barn.;Recommended;141;46.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;If you like ark and Pokemon you'll LOVE the game. its so fun and addicting!! the devs are also awesome! they are constantly making updates and fixing bugs really fast for being a small team;Recommended;155;189.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I generally avoid Early Access games. I only purchased a couple of the ones in my library and the others were purchased for me by friends that really wanted me to try something with them.Boy am I glad I did this time.This game is very, VERY far from polished but it is a lot of fun. Beats the heck out of Valhiem for sure! LOL!;Recommended;263;15.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is a great game for four friends who are looking to play something together. I was skeptical when I first started playing, but I've genuinely warmed up to this game and keep finding myself playing it, even in a solo world. It has found an excellent balance of mechanics from Pokemon, Ark, Minecraft, and LoZ:BotW. While it is easy to call derivative (and in a couple places is), Palworld's it's own thing.It starts a little slow, and admittedly stays pretty slow/chill for most the game, but it allows you to have some pretty high-stakes battles. You can make a fight harder by refusing to call out a Pal, or you can make it easier by bugging your targets' AI with a couple walls preventing them from pathing to you properly. You can also adjust the world's difficulty settings, heavily nerfing yourself, the enemies, or both! They open a lot of options for that.It has flaws, many that have become common with Early Access games these days. Thankfully, none of the issues I come across impact gameplay. They're issues like animations not working properly, a lack of a story-line being told (there are journals, but that's not the story I mean), Pals getting stuck on things they shouldn't even be able to get on. Things like that. The actions still happen in game, and fixing stuck Pals is as easy as picking them up and throwing them, or removing them and re-adding them to a base.Overall, it's a good game worth the current asking price ($30 currently). Give it a try, you might find you really like it too. I'm certainly glad I got it.;Recommended;1270;39.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;As it stands I cannot recommend this game based on it's core game.Numerous bugs that detract from the enjoyment of the game, path finding is terrible,The music is mediocre at best. Graphics are aesthetically pleasing. The game play is enjoyable with good battle encounters. The key element is all about collecting and levelling monsters to continue your progress to higher tier encounters., building a base with very limited building options.The survival aspect is neither here or there it's just an added option.Building is as mentioned above with constant conflicts with other pieces due to the collision boxes been large.The game suffers from bad fps and there are balancing issues that need addressing.The game is similar to another collecting/battling/levelling monster game. A lot of people whom I assume are emotionally tied to those types two games may not like this review.

They did not do so well on there last game that PP made #StopAbandoningGamesBeforThereComplete. Regarding the bugs there are a few game braking ones. Like if you crash in your palbox then you lose all your pals and your base gets reset to lvl 1 or 2 that bug also corrupted my saved world bummer but it is an early access game after all there is bound to be a few bugs. As to the whole Pokemon vs palworld thing its a good thing!! Because maybe now Nintendo will actually make a good game... They have competition now after all. Don't get me wrong I was raised with Pokemon played the first Pokemon game that Nintendo ever made and everyone there on after that including all the remakes they have done over the years on all there systems. Most of them are good games but not all cough cough Scarlet and Violet. Some are a bit um strange but that's a Nintendo thing lol.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;minecraft + pokemon = 8/10 game for me;Recommended;31;19.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I was reluctant to play Palworld because at first glance it can look like a game that is only a cheap parody of pokemon, zelda breath of the wild, and ark. However for the price I was willing to risk it.Here is what I like about Palworld. It is a cheeky adult oriented (language and such) monster catching/survival/open world exploration game that is addicting in how fun it can be. It also has a great multiplayer system, making me and my sister able to farm and have a lot of fun together.Here is what I don't like about Palworld (writing this at start of early access). Palworld lacks a lot of soul. There so far isn't any real story, which I suppose isn't a necessity for these games but I enjoy them. I wish the creatures had a more unique art style. Most of the pals are unique from pokemon, but the artstyle is so similar it feels limiting for Palworld to be appreciated as its own thing. The human models are unique, but the creatures look like they belong in a different setting.All in all, I look forward to what the final release of Palworld might bring and still recommend it as a long term entertainment at the least.;Recommended;921;21.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I was reluctant to play Palworld because at first glance it can look like a game that is only a cheap parody of pokemon, zelda breath of the wild, and ark. However for the price I was willing to risk it.Here is what I like about Palworld. It is a cheeky adult oriented (language and such) monster catching/survival/open world exploration game that is addicting in how fun it can be. It also has a great multiplayer system, making me and my sister able to farm and have a lot of fun together.Here is what I don't like about Palworld (writing this at start of early access). Palworld lacks a lot of soul. There so far isn't any real story, which I suppose isn't a necessity for these games but I enjoy them. I wish the creatures had a more unique art style. Most of the pals are unique from pokemon, but the artstyle is so similar it feels limiting for Palworld to be appreciated as its own thing. The human models are unique, but the creatures look like they belong in a different setting.All in all, I look forward to what the final release of Palworld might bring and still recommend it as a long term entertainment at the least.;Recommended;921;21.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is in EARLY ACCESS, version 0.1.4, and it is already better than a lot of AAA games with 300 devs and 100m budget, while this teams is made of 40 very new and young but passionate devs. Will this game lat or will it be a flash?

Right now there's not a lot to do, but I have high hopes that this changes in the future. Right now you can catch all 134 Pals, build decent bases, and fight bosses.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Eh for less than 30$ I got my money worth. Its fun for a while but gets overly grindy like all of these survival games do with little real payoff. The catch rate is horrific and at the cost of pal spheres later on its not even worth bothering half the time. Having gotten to endgame and spending most of my time just grinding mats for pal spheres that are 90% wasted. Time is better spent breeding for every combo, plus you get better passives with breeding. But its extremely boring breeding for long periods of time as well.We will see where they take the game, but having played ARK in early access and for many years I really do not foresee this going much better. Nice idea but really has no longevity and I will be surprised if it lives past the hype this year.;Not Recommended;622;74.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"A Fresh and Engaging Twist on the GenrePalworld brings a refreshing and entertaining take on the action-adventure, survival, and monster-taming genres. From the moment you step into the whimsical world of Palpagos Islands, it's clear that Pocket Pair has crafted a gaming experience like no other.Gameplay Mastery:The gameplay in Palworld is a true standout. The blend of creature capturing, base building, and combat provides a dynamic and immersive experience. The freedom to explore the open world, manage hunger levels, and craft tools adds layers of strategy that keep players engaged and invested in their Pal-filled journey.The game's comedic premise, often humorously described as ""Pokémon with guns,"" is a stroke of genius. The incorporation of firearms and unconventional uses for the captured Pals adds a unique and unexpected layer to the traditional monster-taming formula. It's a bold move that pays off, giving Palworld a distinct identity in a crowded gaming landscape.The introduction of various factions with their own agendas and powerful leaders adds depth to the narrative. Boss battles against these factions provide a challenging and thrilling aspect to the game, encouraging strategic thinking and skillful gameplay.Palworld's multiplayer capability is a standout feature. Whether playing solo or with up to 32 players on one server, the game seamlessly transitions between cooperative and competitive experiences. The incorporation of dedicated servers enhances the overall multiplayer experience, making it a social and immersive adventure.The game's visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 4, deliver stunning environments and adorable creature designs. The lively and vibrant Palpagos Islands come to life, creating a visually captivating world that players will want to explore and inhabit.Positive Industry Impact:Palworld's success in terms of sales and concurrent players on platforms like Steam speaks to its broad appeal. It's not just a game; it's become a phenomenon, showcasing the potential for innovation and creativity in the gaming industry.In conclusion, Palworld is a delightful surprise that successfully combines humour, strategy, and creativity. Its innovative approach to the monster-taming genre and the sheer joy of interacting with Pals make it a must-play for fans looking for something fresh and exciting in the gaming world.";Recommended;2023;44.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I simply love this game.Since I was a kid, I remember being exposed to the open world concept with nothing, but your bare fists to protect or attack. Then the idea to use creatures in the world to fight with you.And this game does that. And that is just a taste of what you can do.- Base building and defending against raids.- Resource gathering, crafting and automation.- Melee and ranged fighting, bows, crossbows and fire arms.- Fighting along side or while riding on top of the creatures.- Singleplayer, multiplayer with dedicated server support.- Sharing palls and resources by joining the same guild.- Wide world with inspiring vista's. Hey it's no Ghost Recon Wildlands, but it is pretty impressive at times.And typical open world stuff, storries write themselves, when I attempt to do something horribly fail to eventually find out how to finally get that one pall I want. Then another day help a friend catch one for themselves.Or get in a raid on our main base when everyone already left the server and have it burn down to the ground, while I scurry to move all of the resources to a better defendable base.The palls themselves feel so real, like they have a personality. Not just stand across an apponent staticly and do an attack on command. But walk, fly or swim with you if you are not riding them. Them do their best to stay in front of your view and stare you with those big cute eyes. I love my derpy noodle dragon Chillet and when he bounces by, it is so endearing.I have NEVER played something like this.And it is still in early access, so I am waiting for what is to come.Till then I am looking forward to play this with friends or roam alone in this world and adventure for the foreseeable future.If you are unsure, buy it, give it a chance. Just refund it within 2 hours if it does not tingle your fancy.But I will promise it will be an unique experience.;Recommended;1540;38.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Amazing. I should give this game a 10/10 but that would mean there is no room for improvement but as far as I can see this game has so much to offer. Along with incredible animations and fluid movement the graphic style is a bit cartoon-like but this isn't a bad thing. I love the idea of capturing pets and using them to help build,grow, craft and battle enemies. The crafting aspect of this game is also expansive and very enjoyable. A very unique game that deserves a look and if you so desire, a download, you will not be disappointed.;Recommended;439;6.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I keep forgetting this is early access, the game is amazing, it hasn't got that ""early access"" feel to it, yes there are a few bugs - mainly to do with Pals getting stuck in places and then getting sick from being stood on a roof for days (it's easy to sort it out, put the Pal back in the box, then get them out again and feed them meds).If you like creature collection games, with survival and building elements, go for it - even though there is no story as of yet or ""goal"", there is so much to do and see.If updates roll out and Nintendo don't get involved I can see this easily being up for a GotY award.";Recommended;488;43.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;ark but better;Recommended;12;64.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Amazing. I should give this game a 10/10 but that would mean there is no room for improvement but as far as I can see this game has so much to offer. Along with incredible animations and fluid movement the graphic style is a bit cartoon-like but this isn't a bad thing. I love the idea of capturing pets and using them to help build,grow, craft and battle enemies. The crafting aspect of this game is also expansive and very enjoyable. A very unique game that deserves a look and if you so desire, a download, you will not be disappointed.;Recommended;439;6.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I keep forgetting this is early access, the game is amazing, it hasn't got that ""early access"" feel to it, yes there are a few bugs - mainly to do with Pals getting stuck in places and then getting sick from being stood on a roof for days (it's easy to sort it out, put the Pal back in the box, then get them out again and feed them meds).If you like creature collection games, with survival and building elements, go for it - even though there is no story as of yet or ""goal"", there is so much to do and see.If updates roll out and Nintendo don't get involved I can see this easily being up for a GotY award.";Recommended;488;43.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I can't wait for them to add a story and a little extra to the lore. I really wanna visit that tree, too!This is the game that Arceus shoulda been...coulda been....but wasn't!;Recommended;144;29.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Guys I think the game might be good, but will have to try it out a bit longer to see.Enslaved the savior of the world and made it work full time as a fridge cooler. Forced it to have over a hundred offspring before sacrificing all of them to the parent so it can become the master of fridge cooling. Game of the year.;Recommended;254;367.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Really quite decent game. I may have found a few minor bugs, but seriously playable regardless. I would definitely recommend this game to others. I'm easily going to approach $1 or less per hour played which is a deal in my opinion.;Recommended;191;26.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"One of the best games that I've ever played.Firstly, I would like to thank Pocketpair and the other teams that have helped make Palworld and port it onto other consoles, even going onto more than one console generation (e.g. Xbox 360, Xbox one). It is amazing how many ways they have made the game playable- even on a Nintendo 3DS!To me, Palworld is such a great game because of it's sense of progression with bosses and weapon progression, but it also has a lot of freedom with how quickly or slowly you would like to progress, to take time to build up a semi-civilisation with the many NPCs the game has to offer; although you may not use some of them much, the fact that there is so much that the game has to offer is astounding, with such a diverse set of weapons and possibilities.Another reason to love this game is that there are many different options; be it accessories or your character itself,there is a wide array of choices, with dyes increasing the amount of combinations by a massive amount, or options as far as difficulty, both with choosing a character difficulty and a world difficulty, ranging from casual to extremely difficult. Even further, It creates a real feeling of each adventure being unique and not overlapping.The fact that the game has been going strong for 2 weeks is a testament to it's greatness; 2 years of FREE updates which include (but are not restricted to); new bosses, new armours / accessories, new NPCs, new biomes and new music. This is extremely impressive on it's own, however an enormous modding community will allow the game to remain popular for far longer.It is a shame that the game's updates will most likely cease (with the latest big update being Journey's End). It is still so fantastic and impressive how Palworld has built a world which has pleased millions and has been played many millions of times through. Getting 100% completion in Palworld is near impossible with such achievements as commanding you to do so much as fish for effectively 200 days, which would be at least, I'd say 1000 hours of playtime. yet that isn't even scratching the surface of getting every item in the game, which would take many more hours to complete legitimately. These features as well as the infinite replayability are what have kept me coming back for more for so many years.Thank you so much for this 2 week long roller coaster of a game.";Recommended;1965;91.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I have played Pokemon every since I was a little kid, sadly the most recent games have fallen off a big cliff in regards to content and being good games.Palworld is SOOO much fun and addictive to play. Great to play by yourself and with friends.Support these Devs and not the edgelords over at Pokemon HQ.;Recommended;250;18.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Last tail end of the game is just grind, grind, grind, and hopefully not get instagib'd by Legendarys or Bosses when you pursue that after grinding for materials for several hours to push progress forward.Effigys are bugged and work against your capture rate. The capture mechanic is really poorly done with the results already predetermined when you throw the sphere. So you are just getting a show and maybe capture a Pal after throwing 5-10 legendary spheres at a level 40 Pal. Even editing Dedicated server capture rate doesn't even help in this regard it's all just a 50/50 coin toss no matter what that percentage shows or how the capture rate is set. Player attack is bugged and your Pals will always do more damage. So your just a useless pawn while your watch your Pals AI bug out and be useless also.AI pathing is not great and honestly is the biggest pain point for this game. It's not fun when your level 50 Pal is fighting a boss and just circling around them and then the boss starts fighting only you instead until your dead.This game is fun in the early game but i would not recommend this game if you want to complete it fully. Levels 40-50 feels like a slog and drawn out for no reason just to inflate your game time. Spheres capture rates being bugged just adds to this problem. It's not really a challenge when the game just inflates bigger numbers with the same mechanics every other Pal does to overpower you. Netcode is just terrible also with many dedicated server bugs that results in clipping into the ground and Pals just killing you from 100% to 0% due to the lack of the server updating ticks properly.Hope they fix these issues but for a game with a strong start the ending just leaves you not wanting to play anymore.;Not Recommended;1432;59.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Love all the different pals and the open world concept. Love that I can play with friends and make my own house. I would recommend to anyone who likes Pokemon games and games such as Animal Crossing;Recommended;162;38.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A fun game to play with friends but a heavy wip. Lots of bugs that are mostly visual but one that randomly clips you through the water, killing you. Your items are then lost forever because they don't float.;Recommended;169;10.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game is very well done and I am absolutely loving it. Has the pokemon scarlet feel but the building your own base.;Recommended;93;20.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Overall its a fun survival game with a splash of monster catching and exploration in a PVE environment. Its more fun with friends but can still be fun solo. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival and monster catching.;Recommended;194;43.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Finally a new game that is fun to play. All of my friends were talking about this game and I had just enough to buy it. The first couple of hours are hard to get through mainly because its your first time through. However even with that, the mechanics are really simple and even remind me of Zelda Breath of The Wild and Pokemon. 10/10 worth the money.;Recommended;285;9.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Are you tired of the same old ""cute"" and ""cuddly"" games? Well, buckle up, because Palworld is here to blow your expectations out of the water (and possibly into orbit)!In Palworld, you're not just collecting adorable creatures; you're forming an explosive friendship with them. Think Pokemon meets Michael Bay. From the creators of the ""Oh, so fluffy!"" franchise comes a game that's more ""Kaboom!"" than ""Kawaii!""The first thing you'll notice is the diverse range of pals you can befriend. But these pals aren't just for hugs and tea parties; they come with their own set of skills, like farming, building, and, of course, causing chaos. Forget watering crops – why not let your fire-breathing friend handle that for you?And let's talk about the crafting system. Move over, knitting and potion brewing; it's time to create weapons and explosives to defend your land. Who needs a pickaxe when you can have a rocket launcher? Palworld takes the phrase ""crafting with a bang"" quite literally.But the real star of the show? The unpredictable AI. You never know if your pal will follow your command or decide it's the perfect time to blow something up. It adds a level of excitement that keeps you on your toes – and sometimes running for cover.Palworld's graphics are a perfect blend of vibrant landscapes and cartoonish chaos. The juxtaposition of adorable pals wreaking havoc in a picturesque setting is both hilarious and oddly satisfying. You might find yourself laughing maniacally as your pals cause controlled chaos around you.In conclusion, Palworld is not your grandma's pet simulation game. It's a wild, explosive ride that turns the idea of friendship into a hilarious, heart-pounding adventure. So, grab your pals, gear up, and get ready for a blast – both figuratively and literally!";Recommended;1498;13.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"The Dark Souls of Adventure gamesIt's very slow, involves heavy backtracking and the ""fast travel"" mechanic is deceiving.If you came for ""Pokémon with guns"" you won't see that until much later in your experience. Maybe if you enjoy survival games like Ark survival evolved, but if you're more accustomed to single player open world adventure games like BOTW you can't help but think of how empty the world of a whole is.The biggest pro in the game is that it does feel rewarding to make progress, or rather have automation within your base or compound of Pal's performing certain tasks and actions after being setup but the overall gameplay loop that it feeds back into is tedious.Many of these features will probably be fixed relating to the teleportation, map ability to find and see respawing ores and locations of certain pals, but as the game is now I cannot recommend this as a single player experience. According to many others, multiplayer faced many slowdown and server issues, but that seems par of the course for a game this popular in early access.Palworld is a game where a little quality of life would go a long way, but that quality of life isn't in the game yet. 4/10.";Not Recommended;978;3.9;

It's a survival game with tons of automation possibilities on your base for your pals so you can focus on exploring and at the same time knowing your base is taken care of and ready to receive you and your Pals after a day of exploring.A lot of fun with a significant other or friends.

It's like Pokémon, Zelda Botw and Fortnite made a baby. All the good stuff we enjoyed in the other games glued together in a potpourri full of possibilities.And thus I ACCIDENTALLY SLAUGHTERED MY OWN PAL, I SWEAR, WHO THE HELL THOUGHT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SWITCH ""PETTING"" WITH ""SLAUGHTER"" WHEN YOU HAVE THE MEAT CLEAVER EQUIPPED???!!!!Anyways, as I mourn over my lost pal over a good kebab, I can recommend the game without reservation.";Recommended;476;10.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is more a preview of this EA. I have a blast playing this! This is what I wanted for so many years in Pokemon: survival, creating and capturing creatures. The building aspect could be more polish, but the core aspect is solid. This is also the case for the catching and open world.There's still some rough edges for Palwolrd. First, there's a lot of bugs, especially with the AI. Also, the combat in this game is clunky. I would love to get an auto-lock target mechanism. Spheres can get very expensive to make later (and to miss your target) on and it would be less frustrating to have this feature. There's also a lot of issues in the multiplayer that need to be fixed.The game needs more time before an official release, but at this state, it is huge and fun. Highly recommended!;Recommended;644;41.0;

(The fire and cold resistance armors are the same, why design cool looking female cloths when sex appeal amiright. Only guys are going to play this fun animal collection and survival building game yep yep.) Even the option to have more logical cold clothing would be nice. It's annoying to be running around in skimpy outfits constantly.;Recommended;422;26.9;

Lets see where this game goes from its initial launch.Is it worth its money I would say yes, there is a good amount of content in it for the 30 you pay.The Devs seem to have priority for bug fixes etc. Hope they continue to make this game even better in the coming year(s).;Recommended;448;19.2;

I got ready to throw my balls at this bird and some purple Buck just came out of nowhere and headbutted my bird off a cliff to her death. Now this buck works for me chopping logs all day with his head while i ride his sister across the whole country. oh how the tables have turned. 10/10;Recommended;341;6.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;So I honestly just learned about this game recently because my friend bought it for me and I love it! Its what pokemon could have done but didn't, fighting along side your pals, fun dungeon fights, and hours of hours of game play! The exploring and building can be quite tedious, but the enjoyment I get playing this game is insane. Hours go by and I do not even realize it. People hating that its a rip off pokemon doesnt realize pokemon rip other games off to so who cares as long as its fun. So far I do not know much of the story but the game play is solid, the fights are fun, and the coop play makes it so much better.The game is not perfect their are some dumb bugs, exploring can be really, really difficult, but its minor compared enjoyment I get playing with friends. Even playing solo is amazing. I gotta rate this game solid 8 out of ten. I take out 1 point from not understanding the story so far but that maybe my fault to be honest and another for a few of the bugs.But Egg exploring and fighting both people and pals is fun. This game is like rust, pokemon, and monster rancher but with all the good aspects and none of the bs the other games have.;Recommended;939;30.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This review would be positive if the multiplayer was better. The servers lag like crazy but that's not the reason for the review. 10 year old kids will download a program and 12 viruses to gain admin console commands and set your player weight to negative so you can't move, delete your structures, kick you from the game, ban you from servers etc... Multiplayer and PvP will be hype but as of now, unplayable and you can't get very far. Takes about 2 hours before someone jumps in and starts doing this.;Not Recommended;413;32.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Its just an enjoyable game and i lose so much time playing before i know how many hours have passed. Its a simple yet challenging game later on if you dont make your server easy with changes but i do recommend some quality of life changes for the max number of pals and also egg hatching timer turned off bc waiting 2 hours at endgame makes no sense;Recommended;282;113.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game takes the best aspects of Pokemon, Ark, Zelda BOTW, Valheim, and probably more I'm not aware of and it just works so well. Naturally, early access brings bugs, but I've never encountered anything game breaking, although I did get stuck in a wall one time after 30+ hours.There are a lot of things I'd like to see added to the game, though. I'll edit this as I think of more. For now, here's what I would like to see:* Add a pull all to palbox button for in case any pals get stuck. This would just teleport them all to the palbox.* Unique Habitats/Terrain for pals: For example, Beegardes could live in hives which you can break for honey, and the birds like Nitewing could build nests out of wood they find on the ground.* Something to make it easier to select what you want when you're near multiple buildings you can interact with.* Different designs for walls and housing.* A copy-paste button so it does not take (and this is not an exaggeration) 2-3 hours to relocate a base.* A whip so I can abuse my ""pals.""";Recommended;836;65.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The base building and attacks of all the different types of pals are the reason I keep coming back to it!;Recommended;85;14.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;best sandbox so far;Recommended;16;127.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is a good game, but it is currently in early access, and it shows. For the most part, the bones of the game works as intended. The pals are cute, and it's worth catching them. The survival aspects are very standard for the genre and generally fine. It's a fun game to spend a few hours in.Pros: The pals are cute and fun to play with. They're more of your partners than in a Pokemon game, because they help you with things like crafting and gathering in addition to fighting. They literally live with you, they don't just spend their time in balls. The map is detailed, and fun to explore. It's engaging to get around, and it has fast travel once you get to places. The dungeons are basic, but tend to have unique or rare pals, so they're worth exploring. It makes a better open world experience, because the world has more of a purpose than it's pokemon counterpart.The downsides:Building is below average in comparison to similar games. This is partially because pals don't seem to path very well. So if you decide to put your hot tub on the second floor, a lot of pals will be randomly unable to find it. But building is also bad because there just aren't many necessary details to make building a fun experience. For example, there is a slanted roof, but not a single tile with a roof tip, nor is there any method of joining roofs going in two different directions. In addition, some decorations are very odd, because they're too tall to put in a single story house. Why?Unfortunately, Pal pathing needs a lot of work. In the wild, Pals can generally avoid falling off cliffs or something, and the ones that want to run can do so reasonably well. Some pal moves, can move the pal where they're kind of stuck and their AI doesn't know what to do. In a base, it can be a chore for pals to actually path to the places they need to go. It's always annoying to see that a pal at my base is hungry, when their feeding station is out in the middle of my base, outside, well stocked, and within view. Similarly, sometimes I just cannot find a pal that I'm looking for in my base, which is annoying when I have to go to the box and move them to my party and back into the base to get them to spawn where I can see them.;Recommended;1799;10.0;

Anyone saying that has a right to that opinion but lets be honest...no one cares. The game is still in EA but I think with some time this game could be way better than anything the bigger companies could come up with, why its taken this long to finally get a game like this is beyond me. The graphics are good pretty good, music is decent, concept is spot on and the story could use polishing but hey we have to remember it is in EA so cut them some slack.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I still think that Visuals dont match, on top of that i still think that some Pals are just too close to some khe-khe-mons.AI is Dumb, Bugs (i now start to believe that it was made but coders who just learning or smthing), Not much of a grind tbh, 68h to kill all bosses and catch all Pals and get all things, and i was f-ing around.Game is fun.;Recommended;277;69.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Honestly this game has enough going for it to be good until you hit ~lvl 25-30 once the real grind for materials begins you realize your base on servers is not chunk loaded so things wont farm over night but your pals will still take damage and all your food will still spoil but your pals will not eat, farm, or work, just rot and become useless. The game revolves around you catching and leveling pals but somehow you still need to tank all the damage in a fight, leading to an endless and tiresome grind to either find pals that will put the enemy down quickly enough (obv) or to find blueprints for high lvl gear and weapons. Somehow enemy pals can still damage you while they are inside a palsphere being captured, somehow they can shoot through and phase through anything solid. Somehow enemies can damage you twice with one attack leading to being just straight up robbed of a victory during a fight. Honestly I know this game is early access but at this time we know that's just a marketing ploy to avoid negativity for releasing broken games so they can achieve funding. Road map is slow due to the fact the devs have obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off onto a vaction of hookers and blow.Give it a few months on before wasting time on this, its playable but a slog through mud that shouldn't be there.;Not Recommended;1058;70.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has a lot of promise, but currently is experiencing issues making it nearly unplayable. This includes but is not limited to: Lag and desync in multiplayer, lock ups bad enough to require hard resets to your pc, and saves that will delete themselves not only out of the normal save file but also the back up save file.This game really needed a few more months of development. Being released in such a state is ridiculous. And before anyone starts citing sales, I'd like to point out that 2/3 of players haven't even caught 50 pals (this is something done with your first hour or two).

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Approaching the end game and really can't recommend this experience as a whole. Game is addictive true and first 20hrs are kinda fun. The fun partially comes from the unknown map to be explored and unknown pals to discover. So you can't really stop there can you? However the mid/late games are just a big letdown for how buggy and how shallow everything is. Early access isn't quite right to describe the lack here. The fundamentals feel so poor that you better remake the world and put some real level design in. It's an insult to open world.I'm all for this game making people can't go back to pokemon anymore, and I cheer for its success. But also irritates me how they brag about their unprofessional development team. Don't worry it really shows, patching means reinstalling the whole game, fixing one bug introduces two more bugs. In this new update, even though it's in the middle of the day, if you are in the shadow you can't see ♥♥♥♥, forgot to rebake the lighting yeah? Combat Pal will now more frequently do nothing facing some wrong way, you call this improving the AI?Staff your team, get some designers engineers and QA, go for some bigger rework instead of adding more content on top.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Pros:1) It's the true ""pocket monster experience"" i've been waiting, what took the pokemon company 30 years to make (pokemon: archeus) but better, pokemon is virtually unchanged in the 30 years we've had it, palworld tries new things and tries obvious things which the pokemon company failed to deliver many and many times or oddly enough never thought of such as having the pocket monsters actively help ya build, perform tasks, live their lives just to name a few.2) the world is immersive, fairly big and for somebody that usually gets bored in the early game/levelling phases of a game and wants to get to the endgame quickly to enjoy the endgame I gotta say I enjoyed the whole way through, and i've enjoyed it so much i've done it 2 times so far and i'll do it again soon once they deploy a few more bug fixes.3) The graphics are fantastic and performance is good, even on my mediocre pc (the minimum requirement listed are not necessary by the way I feel like the devs listed ""advanced requirements"" on purpose because they wanted people to have better experiences or something). In this new age of poorly performing games/ports on pc it's a welcome surprise for how well it performs.4) The devs are doing a good job fixing many of the bugs the game is plagued with, something that you unfortunately don't see done enough/well as of lately in the videogame industry.5) I used to think of myself as a ""breeder"" when I played pokemon games, I used to collect them all and try to make perfect breeding pairs of ANY/ALL pokemon. The palworld devs had a neat new idea about breeding where there's crazy crossbreeding for DIFFERENT pals. I initially thought this would be bad because it would make finding pals in the wild less intriguing BUT I was wrong, not only do pals in the world still maintain value as, they drop materials needed for crafting/schematics, the wild pals can also be shiny AND offer a nice challenge when one wants one. The added challenge of finding suitable crossbreeding pairs can be nice alternative for those of us that don't always want to fight/sometimes want a break. Be aware though that not all pals can be crossbred (specially true for legendaries), there's plenty of websites/programs on the internet that can tell you what breeding pairs will give you so just rely on the good old internet for answers.Cons:1) the game is in alpha so there's server resets/bugs, don't expect your saves to be 100% stable/safe for now.2) The game still has a fair amount of bugs even after 2 (very good) patches, right now for example I lost my latest week old safe (which I can't even get back from my backup oddly enough), a lot of the worst ones have been fixed with the last 2 patches which is amazing and not something I was expecting to be done so soon and so well to be honest, but nonetheless there's still plenty of bugs and that's to be expected given it's a alpha, if it bugs you maybe wait a little bit of time before purchasing.3) The ai needs work, a lot of work, thankfully the devs are aware and willing to work on it (at least that's what they say) so fingers crossed here.4) For those that dislike ai, the devs have stated they like ai, some people really dislike ai so there ya go probably a few things here and there are ai generated.5) The human settlements/encounters right now aren't many and basically are either a) a boss with a small intro b) a ""vendor town"" or c) some generic pal poachers, if you expected/wanted more from ""humanoids"" and something that resembles a story at least for now, in the alpha, there isn't much, it's basically a pocket monster/survival/exploration sandbox of sorts at the moment and I'm not sure if we are gonna get anything like that tbh.6) The game is in alpha so don't be surprised but there isn't that much to do in the endgame, you go into dungeons, you fight some bosses but mainly.. you BREED which takes up a lot of time.In conclusion: If you want what ""in my opinion"" is the true poket monster experience, mixed with a little bit of survival, exploration and base building in a vibrant world that reminds me of breath of the wilds this game's worth the pricetag now that's in somewhat of a buggy state, imagine what'll happen as the game receives more updates.";Recommended;3483;95.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"The game is not that bad, i wish steam would offer a middle ground for recommending.After the initial ""tutorial"" the game does not really give you any reason to continue, no story, no quests or even hints what you could do.I created my first and main base at the beach close the the starting point, anything that wants to raid my base cant to that because they would have to jump a few Meters (like 10 or so, the player does not take any damage) and the wont do that, so perfecting defense is not necessary. Sometimes my Pals get stuck on small rocks or buildings and will then complain that they cant get any food or place to sleep. I can fix that by pulling them out of the base and reenter them into it but that does not feel great.Crafting pal tend to forget the crafting if there are other tasks like hauling stuff around, i wish that you could disable tasks for certain workers but you cant.Progressing the base is useless after you unlocked the 3rd Base, you could still do that and maybe thats the only reason to really progress.The Level of free Roaming Pals are a bit tricky designed they come in Groups by Area but at some point it was not satisfying to catch any Pals in the Zone I was able to play due to my level and gear because the amount of XP and Level ups i was recieving where close to none as I already had 10 of Every Type captured.The Tower Boses are difficult but there is no explanation why I should fight them, I enslave these creatures just as they do, Maybe I am even the Bad Guy.I see no need to Butcher the Pals Food is no issue with just 1 Berry Field per Base, they become self sustainable and I Personaly get enough food wandering around.The Pals are designed nicely and you can see the Inspiration by Pokemon. The Gameplay feels nice, but some features are just useless, like early flying Mounts, they are way to slow and cant fly far, only thing they are useful for is to climb walls when your own stamina is just to low.";Not Recommended;1585;60.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I think this is my first time writing a review for a game on steam. Palworld is one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had in a long time. I think it has more to do with the amount of customization you have when you initially create your world more than anything else. I'm not a big fan of the whole survival game thing, but I can turn most of the stuff I don't like either completely off of just mitigate it to the point where it's not frustrating me throughout my game play. I would more than recommend this to the casual gamer. Some people are heavily comparing this to Pokemon, and while yes you can catch and train monsters the focus here is that there is no focus. You can catch and train a team yes, but that's not the goal. The goal is what you make it and the amount of freedom you have to do as you please is what makes this much more enjoyable. Don't looks at this as a rip off but more of an evolution and competition to the og catch ems.;Recommended;772;35.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld feels like a collection of extremely accessible gaming features meant to draw in a wide audience that most triple A games try to do in order to beef up sales. The only difference being for Palworld they do those features fairly well together without feeling bolted on or just plain Bad.The pal mechanics as far as collecting, combat, crafting and interaction are all what you'd expect from similar creature catching games. Everything roughly functions as it should and rarely doesn't feel rewarding to try out different Pals and skills to see what becomes part of your toolkit.The base building is functional though I feel like maybe they could have eschewed this for just having settlements where the fast travel beacons are located and let you set up shop among different towns and other locales and still have all the same crafting mechanics. Theres nothing wrong with the base building survival stuff, it goes back to what i said about it being extremely popular mechanics for wide audiences.There's a lot of memery and fourth wall jokes at the games own expense and it doesn't shy away from being a weird gap between incredibly cute monsters and totally brutal situations. If you want that kind of experience it's all fairly well made and I give it to the devs for being able to do something most Big Name game companies can't, bring a functioning early access game out on time.;Recommended;1154;19.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;so far, i really like it. the grind is inexistant and with minimal setup right at beginning you can progress steadily and actually focus on exploring or getting new pals, beating bosses and dungeons. if you like building, you can do that. if you like to make things efficient : you can do that. honestly it's a very good surprise. im really having a blast. handling is intuitive and it's pretty cool. there is no like big tutorial and you don't have too be super organise if you don't want to. but if you are, you can actually build impressive automation setup. you can breed your pals to get better pals more suitable for what you need or with better caracteristic or passive. So it's like Ark without the grind and PVP, like Satisfactory or Factorio but with animals moving and operating your stuff and like zelda for the adventure kindn off. pretty nice overall.;Recommended;711;20.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"All in all, Palworld is a fun, functional survival crafting game with a humorous twist on Pokemon that is basically like taking the darker aspects of Pokemon's Pokedex entries and just making the canonical exploitation and violence part of the gameplay.This is ultimately a Parody game, copying the aesthetic of family-friendly titles while having a bit of fun with the premise. To me, though, Palworld doesn't fully commit to the bit. It stays pg-13 enough to maintain a wide appeal, which is, in my opinion, to the humor's detriment. It's there, but it's nothing uproarious.The gameplay is fun, but honestly has been done before, and the joke is obvious; therefore your mileage will vary depending on how funny you and your friends find that joke.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"To address the controversy up front, no. This isn't ""just a rip off of Pokemon"".The gameplay is much more of a survival base-builder than a creature collector. Think ""Ark"". The ""Pals"" are a means to that end. Doesn't sound like Pokemon much, does it?You don't arena-battle your ""Pals"". They're brainwashed slave labor and personal bodyguards. Doesn't sound like Poklemon much, does it?When you're out in the world and facing hostile ""Pals"", you slaughter them and eat them. Doesn't... you get the idea.Nintendo did not invent creature-collectors. Nintendo did not invent pit-fighting. Nintendo did not invent chimeric hybrid creatures. No matter what someone who has attached their entire self-image to being a Pokemon fan will tell you, this is not a ""rip off"". The only reason the word ""Pokemon"" is used AT ALL is visual style, and you can't copyright or trademark a style. Nintendo's lawyers and those egging on the megacorporation to crush the indie developer can go pound sand.Okay. More substantively. At the time of this writing/ranting, the game is in Early Access. There are indeed bugs, a few serious. Authentication and server stability issues, balance needing work, and a bit more creature variety, as well as more depth to the story are all on the plate. But the game is very playable now, especially with a few friends on a private server. I'm having a lot of fun, and bugs aside, it's living up to the hype. It plays well on mid-tier PCs. The game world is large with plenty to explore.Replayability will come with quests, factions etc. which are not in place yet, but for most the ongoing attraction will be in the base-building aspect and tickling the completionist urge. As it stand for 20-something bucks, it's worth it.If the N-Word Corp feels threatened, they can easily respond by upping their own game. The Palworld devs did it with a budget of 7 million. Nintendo has no excuse, and neither do its fans.";Recommended;1602;34.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Seriously fun game. Despite being an early access title, they've nailed all the core components of the game play to create a really satisfying loop that feels more complete than some AAA games on release. Definitely would recommend this game <3 some parts of it feel relatively incomplete, like a bit of a lacking story, but already with the first update you can tell the developers are really taking the feedback of the community seriously, improving game play and QoL within a month of release. Hopefully, that same kind of love given to the game by the devs continue, and we have a gem that spat in the face of an industry titan to produce something genuinely entertaining!;Recommended;559;44.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"To address the controversy up front, no. This isn't ""just a rip off of Pokemon"".The gameplay is much more of a survival base-builder than a creature collector. Think ""Ark"". The ""Pals"" are a means to that end. Doesn't sound like Pokemon much, does it?You don't arena-battle your ""Pals"". They're brainwashed slave labor and personal bodyguards. Doesn't sound like Poklemon much, does it?When you're out in the world and facing hostile ""Pals"", you slaughter them and eat them. Doesn't... you get the idea.Nintendo did not invent creature-collectors. Nintendo did not invent pit-fighting. Nintendo did not invent chimeric hybrid creatures. No matter what someone who has attached their entire self-image to being a Pokemon fan will tell you, this is not a ""rip off"". The only reason the word ""Pokemon"" is used AT ALL is visual style, and you can't copyright or trademark a style. Nintendo's lawyers and those egging on the megacorporation to crush the indie developer can go pound sand.Okay. More substantively. At the time of this writing/ranting, the game is in Early Access. There are indeed bugs, a few serious. Authentication and server stability issues, balance needing work, and a bit more creature variety, as well as more depth to the story are all on the plate. But the game is very playable now, especially with a few friends on a private server. I'm having a lot of fun, and bugs aside, it's living up to the hype. It plays well on mid-tier PCs. The game world is large with plenty to explore.Replayability will come with quests, factions etc. which are not in place yet, but for most the ongoing attraction will be in the base-building aspect and tickling the completionist urge. As it stand for 20-something bucks, it's worth it.If the N-Word Corp feels threatened, they can easily respond by upping their own game. The Palworld devs did it with a budget of 7 million. Nintendo has no excuse, and neither do its fans.";Recommended;1602;34.1;

The biggest and main problem i really despise palworld for is that there is actually 0 plot or story. its just a huge missed opportunity for a explanation to stuff like what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on with the free pal alliance and the syndicate?? like their always found fighting so they must have some beef, like imagine how cool a good and evil play path would be. but ignoring the story or lack there of the game is extremely entertaining on so many levels. killing bosses with friends, dying to those bosses then the reward of finally catching a boss or even the reward of accidentally killing it and grinding up a bit more ammo and levels to take it on quicker the next time. The base building and creativity of automatic grinding systems. in future updates im sure this will get way better but uhh for now the game is just a mere alarm clock for nintendo to actually step up their game and make pokemon the game it should of been all those years ago.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"""Palworld: The Breathtaking Banana Ballet - A Gaming Odyssey Unraveled""Greetings, intrepid gamers, aficionados of the digital tapestry! Join me in a peculiar voyage through the realms of Palworld, a game where the captivating dance of pixels remarkably mirrors the cosmic choreography of a banana. Yes, you heard it right—a banana. Buckle up, for we are about to unravel the mysterious threads that bind this pixelated playground to the vibrant banana universe.At first glance, Palworld may seem light-years away from the realm of tropical fruits, yet beneath the pixelated surface lies a revelation. Picture, if you will, the banana's gentle curvature, akin to the graceful contours of Palworld's pixelated landscapes. The game, like the banana, boasts a subtle elegance that enchants the senses and immerses players in a delightful dance of vibrant hues.Consider the banana's protective peel, shielding its tender flesh from the harsh realities of the world. In Palworld, a similar symbiosis emerges as pixelated creatures navigate the challenges presented by their environment. The game, like the banana, nurtures an atmosphere where players can delve into the complexities of life's journey, peeling back layers of discovery.Now, let's delve into the mystical synergy of the banana's yellow vibrancy and Palworld's visual splendor. The game's pixelated palette, a vivid kaleidoscope of hues, mirrors the banana's radiant yellow exterior, captivating the player's gaze in a mesmerizing spectacle. The pixelated banana ballet thus transforms Palworld into an immersive experience that transcends the mundane.But hold on, dear gamers, for the banana's appeal extends beyond mere visual aesthetics. Palworld, much like the banana's nutritional prowess, provides players with a diverse gaming sustenance. The interactions, the pixelated symphony of life, mirror the nutritional variety packed within the banana's slender form. Just as the banana satisfies the palate with its multifaceted flavors, Palworld satiates the gaming appetite with a banquet of delightful experiences.In conclusion, as we stand at the nexus of Palworld and the banana, an uncanny kinship reveals itself. The dance of pixels, the vibrant hues, the protective layers, and the diverse sustenance offered—all echo the banana's essence.

My first look at Palworld Views: 5This game is great, Pokiman with guns Question of the day: Who or what is your favourite pal? You can find all my social media right here: https://beacons.ai/sirtopster/home Palworld My Review for...What is Palworld?Lets be honest, Palworld is an open world third-person shooter game. You can go around upgrade your base, farm, mine, and most importantly capture pals which are little creatures that roam around the world. There are obviously bosses, and because this is an early access game it looks like they are going to be adding a lot more to come.Initial Thoughts:-""Look at the little cat, I want one!""-""OH S**T I KILLED IT, I MURDERED IT.""-""Well this is nice.""This game is definitely beginner player friendly, weather you prefer controller or keyboard you can play this game. It has a pretty good tutorial that helps you understand the basics of the game. It has straight forward game play that inst complicated until later game, however I am assuming by later game you would understand how to get those materials and how to progress further into the game.The game play of this game is similar to ark in the sense of base building and farming and crafting. It is actually really fun. You can roam around and catch anything... and I mean . Other then the farming and mining there are basic materials that you will need from your pals. For example, the sheep like pal drops wool which can be useful in making early game gear for your character. The building aspect in this game could definitely be improved, however, it is super easy to make a really cute looking base if you put a little bit of effort into it you can make a half decent building, that being said, I would really like to see us be able to add diagonal walls instead of fixed horizontal or vertical walls. For said base you can actually have your pals work on it, having them do everything is much more efficient anyway. There is much more to this game but I will let you guys figure that out for yourself.The graphics are more 3D cartoon, which suits this game pretty well. There are still some glitches however, if you roam far enough there are some floating trees, and sometimes the texture glitches and you can kind of see something that you shouldn't. My friend accidentally glitched through some water one time and nearly died because he was stuck under the actual ground of the water. All and all, its not to bad, it might need some smoothing in the future but it is a early access game so I am not to worried about that right now.They are all just meme lords, though there are a lot of really helpful guides that can help you through your journey. There is no PvP yet however I have a feeling that once they add that it may become a little more toxic in the servers that have PvP, but only time can tell.This game has a lot of replay-ability and you can spend countless hours just in the zone while in this game. It has a lot to do and it takes hours and hours and hours to do it. Plus, then your friend wants you to play on this server they created, so now, you're making a new character and playing the game again. Character creation in this game is a W by the way.In my opinion, this game has a lot of potential and is worth playing if you really enjoy a survival based game. I would not recommend this game if you do not like grinding or if you do not like open world exploration as that is a lot of the game. I had dropped quite a bit of hours in this game so far, if they keep developing this game then I may just have to drop more.-";Recommended;2968;53.3;

There is no PvP yet however I have a feeling that once they add that it may become a little more toxic in the servers that have PvP, but only time can tell.This game has a lot of replay-ability and you can spend countless hours just in the zone while in this game. It has a lot to do and it takes hours and hours and hours to do it. Plus, then your friend wants you to play on this server they created, so now, you're making a new character and playing the game again. Character creation in this game is a W by the way.In my opinion, this game has a lot of potential and is worth playing if you really enjoy a survival based game. I would not recommend this game if you do not like grinding or if you do not like open world exploration as that is a lot of the game. I had dropped quite a bit of hours in this game so far, if they keep developing this game then I may just have to drop more.-";Recommended;2968;53.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've sunk about 25 hours into my personal single player server, I hooked my wife on the game, and our friend group is looking at starting up a server. This game, even in early access, is a true marriage of the best elements of the best games on the market today and a real hallmark of what a game should be when it's released to the public.;Recommended;274;30.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Great game, put 133 hours in so far just one issue I have right now is the base size... It's just so cramped, I'd like to be able to build a nice base but to put everything I need into one base just can't happen. Maybe double or triple the size of the base would be great;Recommended;215;156.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Japanese ARK with Pokemon graphics, with Breath of the Wild open world and climbing mechanics. There is so much love put into this game, like the various pal work animations, the various nice quality of life changes, like being able to auto sort your inventory into chests, build stuff without having to manually grab your resources from chests, being able to grapple when your far over your weight scale, it's just great. the actual gameplay of catching the pals feels like souls-like as well, having to ctrl and parry with your pal's fun. give this game a shot, it's not perfect, there's obviously still some bugs present in early access like the tower boss exploit, but 30 dollars for this breath of fresh air is amazing;Recommended;598;27.4;

Basically, Pal world is a clash between Ark and Pokemon, however this game does what both games offer BETTER, even in an early access state. The game has very limited bugs to work on, a solid foundation to grow, and an already addictive experience. 11/10. Please continue to update this game as I'm blasting through my work shifts to get home to play it.;Recommended;355;13.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;First, I would like to say that I do not typically recommend games, So I am sorry for any phrasing issues.Everyone has an opinion, but I hope that if you are thinking about playing Palworld, then my recommendation will help you :)Palworld has taken the best components of suvival, farming, building, and pet collecting, and combined them to make a good game with a lot of potential. Currently the game is in Early Access, and in some ways it shows. However, for myself, Palworld is completely stable, and I have no dropped frames, lagging, or stuttering. When any of those issues happen it can be frustrating and distracting. I do expect crashes, bugs, and issues from an early access game. But, I am happy to say that the feel, and form of Palworld rivals some day 1 patches from AAA companies.Currently I have 12 hours in, but I do work a full time job so you can expect to this this number go up as time goes on and, I might have a few more things to add later. But, all in all Palworld is a very solid early access game, with tons of potential. I hope the Devs are able to find a happy balance between fixing issues, and pushing out of early access, all while dealing with the unimaginable success they have had so far! I hope that going forward I continue to have nothing but positive things to say!;Recommended;1063;25.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is fun;Recommended;9;25.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Its still buggy and this is under the context of early access.This game is designed to address many asks, which explains why so many people are playing it at the moment.You have an open world map that rewards you for exploring (fast travels, eggs, statues, Bosses, Dungeons, etc...). It's a static map but its so large an expansive I think that's a good thing in this case.You have your traditional base building survival mechanics, chop wood, harvest stone, make a castle. Only down side I'm seeing at the moment is your base can only really be as big as the range of the Palbox area of influence. The fun part here is you have immediate automation support in the form of pals. Most games IF you get automation its mid-end game, Palworld gives it to you basically immediately. Want 100 arrows and its gonna take 5 minutes to build, start it and walk away, a Pal will make them for you. Pals each have unique traits of various levels that help them manage your base, from handy allowing them to make things, to kindling allowing them to cook food and smelt ore.Combat exists and is exciting BUT simple and buggy at the same time. As a player you can fight, but melee weapons require adjustment as you don't always hit your cross hairs. Ranged weapons are great but ammo costs quite a bit to build up and maintain stores of. Pals can fight with you of course and provides a massive source of damage, the problem is when you want to catch a weakened Pal if you don't manage it right your Pals will just kill them. I would love to see a command added ""weaken enemies"" where Pals will only attack and deal damage until the enemy is at 10% or something. Type advantage has a decent impact as Fire attacks make quick work of Grass types. It still needs some balancing as some type's attacks are a bit over powered comparing to similar attacks from the same level in other types.Collecting Game at its core like the other games everyone is comparing this game to its core is about collecting Pals. Pals come in over 100 variations, with sub variations of most of those that change the elemental type of the Pal. Pal's done evolve or change like most monster collecting games however, they level, and you can improve them with Pal condensing but the only way to get every Pal is, catching, breeding, and egg hatching. This is further reinforced with the condensing mechanic which gives you the option to take Pals of the same species and merge them to make 1 stronger Pal, this starts easy at needing a total of 5 (1 to keep + 4 to condense) but quickly ramps as you'll need 16 Pals for the next tier, and it goes up from there.Complaints:These are some issues I have with the game that I think the developers should review.Pal Box area of Influence and building:- The base area seems large at the start of the game but as you progress and get larger work assets (assembly lines, pal condenser, pal beds, farming plots, etc...) It starts to get very cramped, It would be nice to get an extra few meters at key check points in the Base level, such as when we get the ability to make more bases, and at max level.- Base building doesn't like interacting with Terrain which means if you want to build against a cliff you need to push out enough it doesn't interfere with your walls. If you want to make use of ruins you can't.- Palbox is too small for end game, My level 50 friend is constantly struggling with an over full Pal box because they're trying to get enough pals to condense to tier 4. We've taken to using the viewing cage as a sort of back up bank to hold Pals to clear space. Much like base level and range, at key thresholds it would be nice to grow the size of the Palbox for storage, with tier 4 being double.Guilds:Right now the only use of a Guild is to add your friends to your base and gain access to the resources. This should have some more functions ideally.- Guild Palbank, in the Palbox have a tab for the guild to store Pals, that anyone in the Guild can pull from.- Something to share fast travels, new server members have to explore the map for themselves, the only help is base warps, but if your friends are on an expedition you can't meet up with them easily. (maybe a higher level tech item?)- Portable fast travel markers: Something you can carry that would allow others to FT to your location, maybe with a cool down it could be used to warp to a base even. I get stuck a lot exploring and nearest FTs always seem to be a good 5-10 minutes away, and when I go down my friends are always too far away to get me it seems.Collecting:I love playing monster games and collecting all the different creatures, but Palworld can make it a bit harder than it should be. The biggest issue is apparent lack of ways to incapacitate a Pal without killing it, only thing I have seen so far is a stun baton used to shock the Pal and temporarily paralyze it. Adding more ways to do that, put them to sleep, moves that won't one shot something and leaves it at 1% health, even a tranq gun would, all help make it more fun to catch Pals. I know I can farm those effigies and they are fun to find, but stronger spheres and effigy collection as the only way to make catching easier kind sucks.Base Management:- You have to initiate EVERY crafting function, at a work bench, so if you run out of polymer for that cool thing you want, you have to que the polymer, wait for them to finish, then que the build you want. It would be nice to have an option to que multiple steps, such as picking high tier armor, and if you don't have the mats but have the materials to make it, you can que the whole process so pals will make the mats, then build the thing you want.- Task priority and min/max resource levels: We had an issue where we ran out of wood, cause our wood cutter was more interested in farming berries than cutting wood (we had 2 other farmers, and over 1k berries at this point) Having a system to prioritize the gathering tasks, and set inventory goals would be amazing, even if it was something like advanced tech at level 50.- Storage: I love how my pals will keep my base clean and dump resources in boxes for me. I'd love it more if I could lock them out of certain storage containers I have set aside for specific uses. Adding functions like prioritizing stacking similar resources instead of taking to the nearest box (so I don't have wood in 10 boxes) Really advanced have the ability to define the type of material each box can receive (crafting material only, armor only, etc..)- Doors: Similar vein I made a personal room and didn't want the base pals using chests in there, so I made a door added security and found out that only impacts other players. Expanding security settings lock out Pals would be nice.Pal Management:Keeping Pals happy can take a lot of work initially, with making sure you have food and beds, and gets harder trying to keep up on medicine and other things. Having a way to properly play with your Pals and raise their happiness levels would be nice, and not just petting, but adding a minigame or something. (Maybe a soccer field with that larger base size)";Recommended;5788;42.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is an white-glove slap to Gamefreak and the Pokémon Company to show that you don't need much to make a good pocket monster game nowadays. I have to admit that this is not a perfect game, actually it has to improve in many aspects but still, an unfinished game like this can me more addictive and fun than the last 5 Pokémon Switch games.The price is on point imo and should grant you over 100+ hours of gameplay. Exploring, capturing or decorating your base are only some of many aspects that this game shines at but, it's not fully polished.Also, forgot to mention, Pokémon as slaves with guns. That's most of it. Have fun.;Recommended;519;79.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Super fun game! There are some quality of life updates needed to make it even better. This is just my opinion.Fix the carry weight system - Make it either easier to level up, make pals able to carry materials for you that doesn't count towards your weight, or remove the weight system (honestly I'm 50/50 on this).Crafting - Make crafting more autonomous, make it to where pals stay attached to the job assigned to, or make the work speed buff on level ups better.Levels - Once above level 50 enable the ability to get more points to level up stats.;Recommended;450;43.0;

Now you can! Do you like pokemon? These are things are cooler because every one has a unique skill like launching a salvo of freedom at the enemy, or being leashed up like your fantasy goth girl, riding up the mountainside for adventure. Do you have 30$ and want to buy something that will actually give an amazing gaming experience where you can distract yourself from the fact that the average american has more credit card and household debt per dollar income in the entire history of the country?

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Thank you GameFreak for giving us all of these dogsht pokemon games to make us appreciate games like Palworld.;Recommended;92;7.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game is the Pokemon-esque open world/MMO style game many of us have dreamt about for years. Playing this was pure fun, from start to finish; it combines the best parts of many different game genres. Base building, open world adventure, monster catching, survival resource gathering, etc. This is definitely worth checking out if you're into any of those types of games.";Recommended;313;72.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;After ~80 hours of playtime my biggest problem with Palworld is that I wish there was more of it, and if that isn't a proof of how fun it is then I don't know what is.I'm not a monster catching genre fan. Nor am I big survival-crafting enthusiast. This game however won me over pretty quickly and is easily GOTY 2024 contender for me even with all the Early Access bugs and problems.It's hard for me to say what exactly kept me glued to the screen so much but I think it was the fact that the Pals are very cute and have very soulfull animations and it was just a joy to observe them doing their stuff every time I returned to base, which in turned pushed me to upgrade my base so I can catch more Pals and put them in my base over and over and over again. This gameplay loop is was just greatly addicting for some reason.The current price is I think very fair for the amount of content and polish present, I had one crash in total, there is some memory leakage, pathing issues, and very rare falling through the floor, but honestly I played plenty fully released games in worse state. However if you don't like Early Access titles I also think it's very reasonable to wait for this game to be in a better state without the fear of shrinking population as playing solo is completely valid and fun experience.Personally I don't regret my purchase at all, so far this game has provided extremely fun and addicting experience and I'll be eagerly awaiting any content updates from the developers as even now after catching all the Pals and fighting all the bosses I'm willing to play more of it.;Recommended;1295;79.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Great game. Way better than alot of finished games. Tons of fun. Enough content to keep you busy for over 100 hours.. Had to load a backup save twice due to corrupted save where pals glitch around and don't do anything. But it was easy to fix and still in early access so I'm ok with that.;Recommended;233;90.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game has been very enjoyable thus far. I enjoy the pacing, the customization of the worlds, as well as capturing the pals and the fighting mechanics. Once you play, it does become addictive and hard to stop. It's a fun game both single player as well as multiplayer, plus the fact that you and your friends could have separate bases or even guilds is a fun twist! The pals are cute, I love how each and every one has their own unique personality and uses. I love the fact that you can pet them, hand feed them, so on and so forth. The fact that you can give them guns or grenades is hilarious, I even find the whole using guns in general pretty silly but very efficient.I do, however have some issues:-Recently there was an update where you can't build structures outside of your base. Sure, yes that is great and makes sense, but at the same time the bases are so small especially since you have to add the pals, the food production, the logging and mining sites, your own house, a ton of chests, plus all of this other stuff that make it difficult to even try to organize unless you build a big tower that'd be hard for your pals to navigate anyways.-I know they're working on mid-late game content, but in order for people to play for 100+ hours and be happy with it there needs to be a decent amount added. It's a great game at first, but after playing for so long it can not only get stressful but mundane.-It's VERY grindy. If you're not ready to grind in game and mess around for hours on end, then this game definitely isn't for you. It's almost ridiculous how much you have to do in order to get ore for iron bars. Really, there should be an ore deposit site that you can put down for your pals to mine at. With how many things need iron after level 20 is ridiculous, not only that but it greatly slows down your progress in a negative way.-Unless you build multiple bases it's hard to get all the materials you need. It makes sense, but with the limitations placed on everything (especially weight carrying) it takes a million trips back and forth to get the items from one base to another. Let's say you need sulfur to make gunpowder, which weighs a ton, but you also need coal... In order to get enough sulfur to make enough ammo to go out and defeat bosses and just travel around you need to level up your weight limit a million times. Which I get, but the fact that you only gain 50 pounds for that and leveling everything else is so small as well it really makes trying to plan out the stat points difficult.-I think what really needs to be implemented are quests and side quests. Unless SOME lore and SOME story elements are added, I don't think it'd be a long-lasting game. Why did we end up on the islands of palworld? Why are there other people like us? Why are we fighting the pal alliance and other places rather than join them? Who are the bad guys and why? What's the point of catching and building up our pal repertoire? I want at least SOME of these answered. All I know is the other people by the fires are terrified of pals and would rather stay away (even though they're out in the open with pals walking all around them).-I would love it if when we put down markers on the map, we were able to label them with text like ""sulfur"" or ""cave boss"" and so-on-so-forth.I love this game (obviously) but I would definitely like to see a lot of things ironed out. Some things feel well thought out while others not so much.";Recommended;2798;72.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game has been very enjoyable thus far. I enjoy the pacing, the customization of the worlds, as well as capturing the pals and the fighting mechanics. Once you play, it does become addictive and hard to stop. It's a fun game both single player as well as multiplayer, plus the fact that you and your friends could have separate bases or even guilds is a fun twist! The pals are cute, I love how each and every one has their own unique personality and uses. I love the fact that you can pet them, hand feed them, so on and so forth. The fact that you can give them guns or grenades is hilarious, I even find the whole using guns in general pretty silly but very efficient.I do, however have some issues:-Recently there was an update where you can't build structures outside of your base. Sure, yes that is great and makes sense, but at the same time the bases are so small especially since you have to add the pals, the food production, the logging and mining sites, your own house, a ton of chests, plus all of this other stuff that make it difficult to even try to organize unless you build a big tower that'd be hard for your pals to navigate anyways.-I know they're working on mid-late game content, but in order for people to play for 100+ hours and be happy with it there needs to be a decent amount added. It's a great game at first, but after playing for so long it can not only get stressful but mundane.-It's VERY grindy. If you're not ready to grind in game and mess around for hours on end, then this game definitely isn't for you. It's almost ridiculous how much you have to do in order to get ore for iron bars. Really, there should be an ore deposit site that you can put down for your pals to mine at. With how many things need iron after level 20 is ridiculous, not only that but it greatly slows down your progress in a negative way.-Unless you build multiple bases it's hard to get all the materials you need. It makes sense, but with the limitations placed on everything (especially weight carrying) it takes a million trips back and forth to get the items from one base to another. Let's say you need sulfur to make gunpowder, which weighs a ton, but you also need coal... In order to get enough sulfur to make enough ammo to go out and defeat bosses and just travel around you need to level up your weight limit a million times. Which I get, but the fact that you only gain 50 pounds for that and leveling everything else is so small as well it really makes trying to plan out the stat points difficult.-I think what really needs to be implemented are quests and side quests. Unless SOME lore and SOME story elements are added, I don't think it'd be a long-lasting game. Why did we end up on the islands of palworld? Why are there other people like us? Why are we fighting the pal alliance and other places rather than join them? Who are the bad guys and why? What's the point of catching and building up our pal repertoire? I want at least SOME of these answered. All I know is the other people by the fires are terrified of pals and would rather stay away (even though they're out in the open with pals walking all around them).-I would love it if when we put down markers on the map, we were able to label them with text like ""sulfur"" or ""cave boss"" and so-on-so-forth.I love this game (obviously) but I would definitely like to see a lot of things ironed out. Some things feel well thought out while others not so much.";Recommended;2798;72.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I can deal with normal bugs, small rollbacks and servers being down for extended periods of time. What I can't deal with, however, is complete critical server crashes (forcing a fresh wipe) or your entire character being deleted at a moments notice for absolutely no reason.I was level 46, after breeding a team of the best combat pals, disconnected from server and when I came back it was forcing me to create a new character. All of my progress wiped for absolutely no reason, right when I was about to go out and finish the game. This in my opinion is completely unacceptable for a game and probably the most demoralized I've ever felt.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ah yes. The 40 hour mark. After dying about 10 times and just learning how to make bread at this point, I can honestly say this is the best 40 hours of a game I have played in a long time. Aside from warframe and maybe a team ninja game, I have had a blast playing this game. Those first 10 hours or so can be slow and painful here and there, but once you find a groove and you have good pals to help you out, this game really turns into a whole adventure I wish everyone could or can enjoy. As a Gen 1er of pokemon, it makes me happy someone is breaking up the generic creature capture formula and actually making a game that's fun. also the modding scene isn't too bad, but with the devs starting to ramp up their releases, they will break often, but it's definitely worth a try to mod palworld as well. All I can really say is at this point, if you haven't tried the game, give it a whirl. It's a good ass time.;Recommended;731;40.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;So far, great fun. Easy to get into, a bit buggy some times but that is expected from pre-releases. I play during my work hours and its really relaxing 99% of the times. The only thing i dont really like is how few fast-travel stations are out there but at the same time it could be taken as something good.The only REAL problem it has for me is that to get some stuff, to level up you base, it requires you to level up, sometimes up to two entire levels so it kinda feels that you will run out of content fast. Again, i have NOT ran out of content, its just that the level requierment mechanic makes it feel that way.The game still needs some work? yes... but it feels mostly like rounding up the edges, a bit of bug fixing. Mostly the stupid pinguin that keeps getting stuck it random places. If you build stuff too close together your Pals WILL get stuck so, have that in mind and lets hope is something the devs will fix at some point.Besides that, which is neat picking, Its great fun as it is and would totally recomend it.7/10 for me. Some bug fixes and a good constant flow of DLCs and new content for the future and its easily a 10/10.;Recommended;924;11.0;

So hard that projectiles divert from their path and can follow the player. Can be any type. Wind, Fire, Psyche attacks.Its really unfair considering technically your pals body is in front of you.- The auto targeting is so hard that just your presence alone means.. that a wildpal may only attack you, even though your own pal is attacking hard.- The ability to prioritise tasks in your base, can be a simply yes no switch on any station.And yes with how clunky the fighting system is, how insane the durability drop on armor is .. i really hate the aimbot.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;First off I am not sure my gaming time on the Gamepass is included on steam, so it is more like 60 hours of playing this game :)At first glance it is very much similar to many other survival games, some of the building mechanics is a bit annoying (the snapping effect of e.g. walls - also it is annoying that you can not put up a wall under a roof). The way you build your character, is also something people of this game genre have seen before, though I kindda forgot in the beginning that I had the damage from the Pals aswell, so I wasted a few points in attack.When you dive into the game, you are met with a kindda easy start (the first 20 levels or ther eabout), then from about level 25-30 you start to really have to pay attention about what Pals you are fightings weaknesses, etc. From what I have noticed, there is plenty to do after reaching level 50 (max atm.) and I tend to forget that it is an early version of the game, and not near the finished product.So to me I can only recommend this game, and I am looking forward to the finished product. Though I hope they can live up to the expectations, there are now where (to me) the fundamentals of a great survival game are there.;Recommended;962;54.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is incredibly creative and fun. they went above and beyond anything that Pokemon has done in the past decade, so the people trying to compare the two need to actually play the game. its not the same game. Palworld is immensely more cooperative, it has its own lore within and story that seems like it could go really far if shown support by the community. I have had a few glitchy moments with the game but that is a given because it is still in that trial period, which leads to my next compliment to this game, the reporting process for glitches, bugs, or even just suggestions is really simple and convenient to use for any issues and I've seen things I've reported in the patch notes so i believe they haven't went unheard. I definitely recommend this game and hope that the devs keep on putting together great ideas like this one.;Recommended;691;29.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;this game has everything ive wanted, beings with extraterrestrial power, building bases, and guns. but maybe this game would be 10/10 if i could place a foundation at the bottom of stairs in order to keep my way up a mountain looking neet/ not a hassle to make;Recommended;213;14.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"If I were to describe this game as concisely as possible, I would say it is ""ARK: Survival Evolved"", but with Pokemon instead of dinosaurs.Since the game is in early access, you may wonder what its status is. Is it even playable? How complete is it? Does it crash often?At the moment, I would say that the game is fully playable. It has never crashed on me. The main things that indicate that the game is not yet finished are:- unevenly filled locations. Starting locations are full of everything. There are Pals or syndicate members at every turn, terrain is interesting, every nook and cranny is worth exploring, because on every hill there is a reward, such as a reward chest, a Pals' egg or Lifmunk Effigy (which by the way are worth collecting at night, because you can see them vividly then). On the other hand, high level locations (which are huge) feels empty: there are often no Pales in sight, there are definitely fewer Lifmunk Effigy and terrain itself is less diversified (either huge spaces, or huge mountains with almost nothing on them). These final locations are just boring. If you want to explore 100% of the map, you will spend a lot of time just flying boringly.- Pals getting stuck in bases... this is probably the most irritating thing right now. For now, I recommend making your bases in large, empty and flat spaces. Otherwise, Pales will often be in places they can't get out of (like near a steep slope, if you have a mountain in your base, they can also be inside of it), so you have to manually reset them every time you are in the base, because otherwise they will start dying of hunger (and they're not productive). And surrounding the selected area with a palisade does not help. If part of the base area is outside of palisade, when you return to it, it'll turn out that some Pales are somehow outside of palisade and can't come back inside...- enemy base raids are currently very underdeveloped. Currently, they work in such a way that enemies spawn some distance from the base and run towards it, but only when they reach it, they start to be aggressive and attack. Until they get there, they don't attack. So you can easily intercept them on the way and eliminate them without resistance before they even reach your base. In addition, depending on where you build the base, it may turn out that they will approach the hill next to the base and will not be able to climb it... So they will stand there and wait for someone to kill them without putting up any resistance. Building a palisade around your base also usually causes enemies to run around as if trying to bypass it instead of trying to destroy it. On the other hand, there can be raids that completely wipe out your base, because, for example, 20 flying Pals spawn at your level and massacre everything (but even they often block on palisades). Interestingly, when this occurs, apart from incapacitating all Pals (who recover after rest), raid enemies only destroy structures. So if you have no structures in your base and everything is put directly on the ground, nothing will be destroyed (probably just damaged by area attacks). To sum up - enemy base raids definitely require a lot of work.Apart from that, I can say that the game is completely playable. Sure, some of its elements could still be improved (e.g. dungeons are quite boring, and you can currently just fly through them without fighting anyone, interactions with NPCs are also currently limited to an absolute minimum), but the game is really playable.One of the things that the game can be praised for is its audiovisual setting. Stylized graphics, animations and sounds create a nice atmosphere.Surprisingly, the fight itself is also fun and nicely done, which was not so obvious, because it combines battle of Pals, where they cast various ""spells"" with their own speeds and cooldowns, with traditional gun firing.You can't really call this game innovative, it just takes cool elements from other games and combines them. However, I have impression that main motivation for the creators to add mechanics to their game was to make it enjoyable. For example, in the ARK game, when you make items at a given station, you must first manually transfer raw materials to it, which may even be in the box next to it. This is quite tedious and in a large base, a lot of time is wasted on moving materials manually. That's why in Palworld it works differently - if raw materials needed for production are in a chest at a certain distance from station, they are automatically taken from it. It seems like a small change, but it eliminates a disliked part of the game.To sum up, I recommend the game to all fans of survival games and Pokemon - you shouldn't be disappointed. I can't wait for the full game to be released.";Recommended;3933;60.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;There's nothing new and ground breaking about this game, it takes the best features of other popular games and puts it all in one game, which makes it a good game for the price point.;Recommended;149;26.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;this game has everything ive wanted, beings with extraterrestrial power, building bases, and guns. but maybe this game would be 10/10 if i could place a foundation at the bottom of stairs in order to keep my way up a mountain looking neet/ not a hassle to make;Recommended;213;14.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"If I were to describe this game as concisely as possible, I would say it is ""ARK: Survival Evolved"", but with Pokemon instead of dinosaurs.Since the game is in early access, you may wonder what its status is. Is it even playable? How complete is it? Does it crash often?At the moment, I would say that the game is fully playable. It has never crashed on me. The main things that indicate that the game is not yet finished are:- unevenly filled locations. Starting locations are full of everything. There are Pals or syndicate members at every turn, terrain is interesting, every nook and cranny is worth exploring, because on every hill there is a reward, such as a reward chest, a Pals' egg or Lifmunk Effigy (which by the way are worth collecting at night, because you can see them vividly then). On the other hand, high level locations (which are huge) feels empty: there are often no Pales in sight, there are definitely fewer Lifmunk Effigy and terrain itself is less diversified (either huge spaces, or huge mountains with almost nothing on them). These final locations are just boring. If you want to explore 100% of the map, you will spend a lot of time just flying boringly.- Pals getting stuck in bases... this is probably the most irritating thing right now. For now, I recommend making your bases in large, empty and flat spaces. Otherwise, Pales will often be in places they can't get out of (like near a steep slope, if you have a mountain in your base, they can also be inside of it), so you have to manually reset them every time you are in the base, because otherwise they will start dying of hunger (and they're not productive). And surrounding the selected area with a palisade does not help. If part of the base area is outside of palisade, when you return to it, it'll turn out that some Pales are somehow outside of palisade and can't come back inside...- enemy base raids are currently very underdeveloped. Currently, they work in such a way that enemies spawn some distance from the base and run towards it, but only when they reach it, they start to be aggressive and attack. Until they get there, they don't attack. So you can easily intercept them on the way and eliminate them without resistance before they even reach your base. In addition, depending on where you build the base, it may turn out that they will approach the hill next to the base and will not be able to climb it... So they will stand there and wait for someone to kill them without putting up any resistance. Building a palisade around your base also usually causes enemies to run around as if trying to bypass it instead of trying to destroy it. On the other hand, there can be raids that completely wipe out your base, because, for example, 20 flying Pals spawn at your level and massacre everything (but even they often block on palisades). Interestingly, when this occurs, apart from incapacitating all Pals (who recover after rest), raid enemies only destroy structures. So if you have no structures in your base and everything is put directly on the ground, nothing will be destroyed (probably just damaged by area attacks). To sum up - enemy base raids definitely require a lot of work.Apart from that, I can say that the game is completely playable. Sure, some of its elements could still be improved (e.g. dungeons are quite boring, and you can currently just fly through them without fighting anyone, interactions with NPCs are also currently limited to an absolute minimum), but the game is really playable.One of the things that the game can be praised for is its audiovisual setting. Stylized graphics, animations and sounds create a nice atmosphere.Surprisingly, the fight itself is also fun and nicely done, which was not so obvious, because it combines battle of Pals, where they cast various ""spells"" with their own speeds and cooldowns, with traditional gun firing.You can't really call this game innovative, it just takes cool elements from other games and combines them. However, I have impression that main motivation for the creators to add mechanics to their game was to make it enjoyable. For example, in the ARK game, when you make items at a given station, you must first manually transfer raw materials to it, which may even be in the box next to it. This is quite tedious and in a large base, a lot of time is wasted on moving materials manually. That's why in Palworld it works differently - if raw materials needed for production are in a chest at a certain distance from station, they are automatically taken from it. It seems like a small change, but it eliminates a disliked part of the game.To sum up, I recommend the game to all fans of survival games and Pokemon - you shouldn't be disappointed. I can't wait for the full game to be released.";Recommended;3933;60.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;EZ 100 hours played in 2 weeks (still have 7 levels till 50 and a fair bit of stuff i haven't fought yet ) This game scratches so many itches. I keel, I catch, I cook, i get cold, im hot now, i build base, fire man burn it down lighting campfire. I turn base into *WORK* camp and move on. sip a chug jug irl and think about the good days. Anyways bird glider across the map and unload the pump action into mossandra lux. Why reload when I can give him 1 from the kar and a few from the handy. I build an entire factory with ore refinement and mass productions of items. I am rich. What do rich people do? play god. Now I create super, omega, alpha, foil, limited edition, ultra, pal with continuous consensual *dates with cake*.Not sure if it is because I main game osrs, but I heavily enjoy the fact that with boss timers, progression through production/multi bases, and breeding eggs, you can kind of fluidly do whatever you want while always being productive.I do wish the actual placement of objects while building was more like The Forest or Fallout though (like option to disable snap/free place). Like it or not this game is a piece of history. Play it. 9/10PS: okay hear me out, shoutout slapchop, maybe something i can chuck a few pals into and have a big boi smac smac at the base? Maybe i just havent unlocked the electric blender yet.;Recommended;1094;108.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;USE THE CUSTOMIZABLE WORLD SETTINGSNo one can argue that this game doesn't start out super fun. But this game can get grindy once you get into higher levels- the 30's, 40's, and 50's. You can keep the game fun by tailoring all the world settings to your liking. Doubling catch rate, tripling drops, x10 exp rate, x3 pal spawns, 5x damage, x2 gathered materials...Obviously it might ruin the game going too far on these. But remember if things are starting to feel like a slog, just bump up whatever numbers are causing you frustration, and you're back to having fun.;Recommended;467;95.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworl is a phenomenal game if you feel like crafting to explore. It teaches core mechanics that are useful in most RPGs, along with gathering pals. Pals captured while roaming the wild are easy to catch and and you catch multiples of the same, while not growing stale or punished up to 10 catches of the same, so it easy to grow in numbers fast! Pals can help around your base by building structures, working at workbenches, cooking food, watering crops, cooling an icebox, and much more like guarding from raids on your base. It has a few more T rated things like the use of weapons, guns, bows, and even the pals can be used as weapons which helps the battles feel intense.I found myself recaling my Pals in the midst of battle to evade my enemies attacks, it felt so smooth to have my Pal Dinossom launch a Seed Mine volley just before getting back in the Pal sphere to evade an attack. I have spent my time so far exploring things and have about half what I expect maybe another 60hrs.;Recommended;808;47.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's a survival lite creature collector with a bunch of interesting systems and mechanics you wouldn't think would work, but they do. It's fun, you're rewarded for exploring, and there is lots of stuff to build.;Recommended;176;35.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Honestly, I wish people would stop calling this game ""Pokemon with guns"" because there is so much more to the game than that. I'm a diehard Pokemon fan who still enjoys the mainline games despite Nintendo not giving Gamefreak the time or resources to truly polish them. And, as a diehard fan, I can say that I also really love Palworld. It takes the catching mechanic of Pokemon and adds the survival element of games like Minecraft (or ARK is what other people are saying but I haven't played that so I'll just stick with comparing it to MC) and then adds guns because Americans love guns for some reasons. My only real complaint is I feel like some of the designs resemble certain Pokemon a little too closely but Nintendo hasn't taken action so if they don't care, I don't care. Honestly If you got 30 bucks and you like games that involve creatures, survival, and/or guns than you should totally buy this game.";Recommended;750;12.1;

The execution of the game, and progression systems in the game are radically different.Developers did a wonderful job, and i hope their studio can help topple the giant developers that re-release the same games over and over with new skins!;Recommended;264;52.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I am a long time Pokemon fan. Started with Silver, went back to Yellow, when Crystal came out I bought every Pokemon release from then on. Black 2 and White 2 are still among my favorites, along with Crystal and the gen 2 remakes.This gives me vibes like Legends Arceus, with a hint of Valheim but even better.The reason I mention I'm such a huge Pokemon fan is because I am enjoying this game more than anything that has been released since Black 2/White 2.Even the gun aspect of the game is done quite well. You don't start out with guns and it's a long while until you can unlock them. Before then you build your bases and explore the map. Get to know the terrain. There are a few spots you can build a base and they can't even reach you when you get raided.This game feels once in a lifetime. A competent Pokemon rival with great survival elements. This is great for Game Freak and even better for Pocket Pair. Both Pokemon and Pal World will benefit from this game's popularity.;Recommended;801;51.0;

It's early access so it's buggy, but the bugs have made this game that much more entertaining. Having a tanzee launch into the stratosphere trying to catch it is so funny to me. With how much time I've spent in this game alone makes the game more than worth the price (I'm not even level 20 at the time of writing this).

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;If you took botw, actually made it interesting, added multiplayer, added Pokemon, added a build menu from ark you'd get palworld. Probably 80 hours worth of content for a casual completionist. I'm 40 hours deep. No game breaking bugs so far. NPC world bosses are about as intellegent as Skyrim dragons, easy to jank. Nonetheless good fun to be had with real friends (if you have any). Pokemon fanboys can blow it, palworld did it better.;Recommended;362;43.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Freaking love this game. Good mechanics with alot to do. 100+ unique pals with 30+ variants. exciting boss fights that are somewhat challenging. Tons of fun with friends 30 bucks is a steal for the amount of hours you can grind this game;Recommended;195;111.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I waited a week or two before buying the game to see if the hype was short lived or not. It was not. This game is very fun and has a rewarding experience! I would say it is a mix of 30% Pokemon, 50% Ark Survival, and 20% Fortnite. The gameplay is closest to Ark in that it is a survival game in which you tame the local wildlife to assist in gathering, crafting and defense. It has art direction similar to Pokemon Arceus with some UI elements as well. the Graphics and character rigging feel identical to Fortnite.overall i would give this game a 8/10 right on the same itch as Ark Survival.;Recommended;479;81.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's a great game, super addictive, lots of fun, if you enjoy survival games mixed with creature catching you will love this.Each of the pals feel unique with their animations and skills, the breeding system is super easy compared to Pokemon, same for making them stronger.My main issue is once you reach level 40 it becomes really grindy, and the fun slowly starts to dwindle. i found out there is an option to change exp rate and stuff in world settings, i advise people to alter that if you don't enjoy the grind.Also i think the materials needed to craft the legendary sphere (currently highest sphere in the game)is way too much, i think once you reach the ability to craft it, the requirements for materials should be less. for example it should only need paldium fragments and ore.the legendary pals are so difficult, its legit darksouls level hard. people are even finding ways to exploit it so they can even kill/catch them.I'm really enjoying the game and i'm looking forward to what they do with it in the future.;Recommended;845;118.7;

Most devs would say, no way we’ll let have an endgame Pal early, but these guys say F it… Let them have some fun.So if you don’t take things so seriously and wanna just F around in an awesome sandbox, this is it.Last boss I barely beat timer with Leggo rockets and 4 Jetragons with all my souls invested in them and rerolled stats.Adjusted in singleplayer –1.5 XP from level 47-50Insta Eggs – at Lvl 401.2 Stamina Pals.;Recommended;532;76.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game combines several different elements from other games, and does it surprisingly well. I've played a couple of Pokemon games, and the ""gotta catch 'em all"" mentality never appealed to me. But in this game, I want to collect all the Pals, partially because there aren't a thousand of them, but partially because catching Pals doesn't feel repetitive or copied, simply because each fight is unique. The base-building mechanics feel similar to Ark and other games like it, and it's simple enough that I enjoy the building. The combat is pretty good, but it does suffer from some common fighting tropes that personally bother me. The world is incredible and expansive, with each area feeling unique and differentiated. Overall, this game is really good, and I'd highly recommend it. I look forward to watching the development as the game becomes complete!";Recommended;718;15.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;amazing game;Recommended;11;25.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game feel like a strange yet awesome combination of Pokemon, Minecraft and Horizon zero dawn.Collect creatures like pokemon, build like mincraft and fight bosses like horizon. There are many features that I really love about this game.-It's completely open world so you can go anywhere you like as long as you can survive the climbing difficulty levels of both enemies and pals.-The crafting system continues to open up a wider and wider variety of tools and items as your character levels up that help you - both along your journey and to capture higher level pals.-There is a hunger mechanic to contend with if you are to survive which is fortunately not too intrusive. However if you allow your hunger (for either yourself or your pals) to drop to zero, your health will begin to decline until it reaches 1, it does not incapacitate your character outright but will open you up to attacks that may require you to respawn. Depending on the settings that you chose when starting the game, you can toggle off the feature that drops all items and pals on death.-It is worth noting that I did notice any incapacitated pals in your team will be healed to full if you sleep in a bed, otherwise you must put them into your pal box and wait 10 mins for them to start regaining their health back. At surface level this may sound like a lot of time, I assure you it really isn't, simply do some things around your base and the time seems to go by pretty fast.-Eventually you will be able to fly using saddles on flying pals such as Nitewing. Riding a pal not only allows you to avoid using ammo but you can fly and attack at the same time, which is a pretty awesome feature.If these features sounded cool to you then I highly recommend you try this game. Do remember it is in early access at the time I am writing this review, so bugs are expected to happen. I have not run into any myself (to my knowledge) thus far though so it seems to be few and far between.;Recommended;1598;83.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Pokemon with guns, who could ask for more- (JK)The game is fun and I love finding new pals in the world, the world is fun to travel around and I can't wait to see if the place gets expanded or new areas are introduced. I can't wait to see what gets added next to this game.The game can be addictive so fair warning to those that have a work/school life.;Recommended;284;33.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun game play loop of building up your team and base while previous iterations get a bit easier with the right pals at the base working. Great survival game.;Recommended;129;51.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"The AI and QoL for Pal management is so bad i cant recommend it, since that's what im most interested in, and the clunky-ness just adds to the game being bad, i don't know why 6mil people like it but for me it's worse than similar games out there. I guess the only thing attractive is the ""Pal's'' and that's it.";Not Recommended;252;4.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Product refundedAt first, I couldn't even get to the character screen. After scouring the internet for a fix for an hour, my issue became rubber banding to the point the game was unplayable. I understand the rubber banding is more likely on the server host, but no one else in the server had the severe degree I did. By now it was 2 hours of troubleshooting, exiting in and out of the game. Of course, I had tried changing the resolution, graphics, window to fullscreen, etc. And man, there was no need for the fps to be as bad as it was.All of this for what? A brief and uninteresting cutscene, placing a workshop bench down, and catching a pal.Going in I was already on the fence. It's very hyped, which got me curious, but both of it's sales point are things that have been done. Do you want to catch and raise monsters? Digimon, Pokemon, Monster Rancher, Rune Factory, the list goes on of franchises that can get you that fix. Do you want to build something from only the materials you collect? Ark, Rust, Atlas, and Conan Exiles are a few. So I suppose the way Palworld can stand out is that your pals can have guns.Okay, that's more like a plot twist, so what is to keep the player motivated to continue playing after they get over the initial feeling of pokemon with guns?Why is there such a jarring disconnect between the stylized trainers and pals and the rest of the environment?I may after months down the line try this game again, but for now, it's a no go.;Not Recommended;1198;1.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Absolutely love this game it is Pokemon and survival mixed in some thing that if you don't take it to seriously. It is fun collecting the Pal's is a blast building is cool. Just have fun it is a ""Video GAME"".";Recommended;168;18.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;You either like this game, or you're just mad that Pokemon didn't make it. Be mad at pokemon, not the game, it's like Rust and Lost Ark had a baby with Pokemon.Definitely some stuff that needs to be refined, same with any early access, but great. I do wish that bases weren't capped by guild, and instead was capped by player so that way guild members could also make their own base, at least 1. AI needs some improvement, but is really fun, looking forward to them adding more building items too, base building is a lot of fun in this game!Overall def recommend.;Recommended;460;67.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've waited years for this game since it was initially announced. After spending a few hours, it immediately gave me Craftopia vibes. This, this is what Craftopia was meant to be but Palworld is its own game now. I look forward to the future of this game.;Recommended;209;67.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;great game. Been loving it since day one.Good mix of humour and action.Still needs a bit of finetuning here and there. Like customizing your keybinds etc, but also gameplay wise.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I don't like survival games and I'm hooked. This is nothing like pokemon. Its way better. Bought my kids pokemon violet. And it sucked. This blows it out of the water a d for half price;Recommended;150;39.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;That awkward moment when you put in 40+ hours into a £25/$30 game that's in Early Access and find that to be more competent and worthwhile than a majority of games demanding £50-£60/$70.Don't get me wrong: game still has some issues to iron out:- Enemy AI being silly with raids and just stand there- Weird bugs where acquiring items would result in not being able to make new equipment and the only way to keep crafting is to dismantle and rebuild- Power scaling with Tower bosses is questionableBut other than that, a lot of bang for your buck.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I don't like survival games and I'm hooked. This is nothing like pokemon. Its way better. Bought my kids pokemon violet. And it sucked. This blows it out of the water a d for half price;Recommended;150;39.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;That awkward moment when you put in 40+ hours into a £25/$30 game that's in Early Access and find that to be more competent and worthwhile than a majority of games demanding £50-£60/$70.Don't get me wrong: game still has some issues to iron out:- Enemy AI being silly with raids and just stand there- Weird bugs where acquiring items would result in not being able to make new equipment and the only way to keep crafting is to dismantle and rebuild- Power scaling with Tower bosses is questionableBut other than that, a lot of bang for your buck. Looking forward to more content.;Recommended;477;40.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The start of the game makes a lot of fun to play, I kinda fell into a small addiction. But tbh after ~30-40 hours you will see the flaws & the game kinda drops into a hole of grinding resources which gets monotonous.Without the Pal's it's basically just a survival game that adds kinda nothing new.For me personally, there is also no reason to keep playing tbf, catching all pals seems like a lot of work. (world options so its fine)- Leveling feels really slow after you hit 30 (atm 38, and I still need 120k xp which are idk ~20 pals)- crafting ultra spheres gets kinda expensive (setting everything up or farming by yourself > a lot of work)- pals sometimes are getting stuck & stop working (if you don't realize it > sick/dead/hungry)- assigning them to a task works, but once I tp somewhere else and go back to base they're just doing something else again (personal opinion, but I don't like throwing them, maybe give us a building where you have an assign menu)- Not the greatest base building, sometimes kinda annoying to deal with. Feels a bit like the forest- Dungeons are monotonous, there are no variations so far.Quality of Life- It would be great if there would be a solution for moving chests with items in it (maybe an item that you can unlock)It gets kinda annoying if your chest has a total of 20000-50000 weight.- Durability is kinda a joke, 1–3 hits and your armor is broken- be able to automate all early game items / or at least let us buy them at the merchant at some point of the game(You shouldn't struggle with early game items while you're getting into late game.)It's still Early Access so it's fine, but that's my opinion so far.;Recommended;1356;65.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;FUN game;Recommended;7;4.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Obviously the game is new and still developing but it is so good and addicting! Love the survival bit to it and catching all the Pals. I have been raided literally 4 times yesterday but its worth it for the loot haha :) Cannot wait to see more done to the game, it is definitely a 10/10 for me;Recommended;235;27.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The way the game is right now is very much worth to play if you like survival games and the theme is something that you would enjoy. It took me about 80 hours to do all towers and capture all Pals (including legendaries) except for a few, that was longer than I expected but I had a lot of fun pretty much the whole way through. It is a pretty typical survival game at its core, but of course it has Pals added to make for a unique experience.What you pretty much do the whole game is capture a lot of Pals (there are over 130, some of which are variants of others), you can recruit them in your party or put them in your base where they will do specific tasks to automate it. The Pals have pretty terrible pathing issues, so they get stuck in your base and become useless . Another issue I had is that they wouldn't really attack optimally which could be a bit frustrating in tower bosses as those are timed DPS checks so you want them to attack as much and as accurate as possible.Capturing Pals was pretty fun to do until the end where the spheres got really expensive and not that good at capturing Pals. The end game is pretty grindy when it comes to iron, everything needs a lot of it and trying to farm it yourself is not very fun as it weighs a lot and you have pretty limited weight (even when upgraded). So, to combat the iron shortage you set up a base (you can have 3) to only farm iron. The issue I had is that my Pals would only farm it while I loaded the base in (the game can only load one of your 3 bases , so every time I would go on an adventure I had to TP to my iron base.Besides that and the typical survival game elements I thought the map was really well designed and exploring was a lot of fun and very rewarding. The performance was fine, I had some hiccups in certain areas some times, but no crashes and generally smooth fps. The game lacks ambient music, there is zero music while exploring, the music that the game did have was really good and fit the theme perfectly. I played through the game on normal difficulty with raids off (got sick of them) and no items dropped upon death, it wasn't really that challenging but never got boring.;Recommended;1748;86.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is god tier, as a early access games, its actual gold, for a price that makes me think I am robbing the devs, holy crap. I want to make it very clear, this game is early access, but is filled with more than enough to keep you going alone for 30-40 hours, and if you have friends and wanna goof off, well I will see you in a few months.Does this game need work, yes. Do I have faith in a company, who has blindsided the world with a game, that takes the best other games have to offer and makes them fun and enjoyable in a way that feels like most people have wanted for years, yes.I can honestly say, this game is worth a buy, if nothing else, this company deserves it, and when it comes out of early access, this game will be insane. For once I am looking forward to dlc, I hope they will deliver something even more amazing as time goes by.Grab some friends, grab some beers and chill with the boys, catch some pals and put them to work in your T.E.W.F.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is a shoddily put together mess that steals concepts so blatantly you can't help but laugh. And yet it still somehow clearly communicates far more effort and care from the developers than any of the 3D Pokemon games.To be clear I'm not saying the game is only good when compared to Pokemon, it's fun period. Explaining why or how it's fun is just difficult when so much of the game looks so cynically lazy on the surface. Actually playing the game makes it feel more like the devs had a clear idea for a game but either limited budget, talent, time or a combination of all three. So basically every corner that could be cut was annihilated with nuclear force. At the same time there are bizarre areas where an odd amount of effort seemed to be put in. Catch a Depresso and have it do various tasks around the base. It has fairly custom animations for several tasks which are appropriate and hilarious. This single feature is well beyond what any 3D Pokemon game has managed to provide and it bloody impressive. While not every pal seems to have custom animations, quite a few of them do, and they really help give personality to the pals.I'm conflicted on how I want to feel about all of this but for now, this feels like a game built by people who couldn't quite build what they wanted, so made compromises in less important areas to allow room for the more important ones to breath. The whole experience is excellent and fun and I hope it serves as a swift kick in the rear for many other studios about the importance of good priorities.;Recommended;1262;41.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ignore the media around the game, ignore the *insert copyright title here* allegations... at its core, this game is ARK but instead of dinos, you get these anime buddies with magic powers - and its frickin' AWESOME.I love this game, it's the perfect blend of little tiny things from so many other titles combined that i never knew I wanted - and now i'm in love with it.;Recommended;303;56.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ok so overall it's just polemon with guns and what I really like about about the graphics is how it's moemon with guns and the tutorial is abit clunky but it dies a good job of showing the digimon with guns, the charecter you make walks funny and is lowkey kinda zesty but it works really well with the pokemon with guns. Me personally i just think everyone is pokemon with guns and the pokemon with guns are pretty cute theres a sheep one that you can give a gun to so that's but I hope that this isn't a hot take because in the end it's just poekemon with guns. Overall I give it a pokemon with guns/10.;Recommended;487;1.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Some glitches here and there, but clearly not enough to stop us all from continuing. This game is extremely colorful and addicting to any fan of the monster collector genre! I'm excited to see what this project becomes over time especially once it no longer early access.Few suggestions off top my head for the developers:*Have a function to switch which Palball you are using (if there's one I've failed to notice). Perhaps it's been fixed since the time I'm typing this, but the glitch where you ""ran out of Palballs"" but clearly have others of the higher or lower capture rate is annoying.*Please update the Pals' AI to be smarter: not get in the way when you are trying to build, not getting stuck then stressed, and not listening sometimes.Again this is an incredible game thus far and these issues will not stop us from enjoying the fruits of your labor. You've all done amazing work so give yourselves a pat on the back, team!";Recommended;769;26.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;best pokemon game i've played since ruby. no, i'm not joking or memeing. pokemon's so stale at this point that it smells like embalming fluid. this game steals so much from so many other games (breath of the wild, ark, elden ring and others) that it's come full circle and created it's own identity. yes, it's pokemon with guns. but it's so much more than that. and hopefully this game will be the kick in the ass nintendo needs to make pokemon into the game it always had the power to be, instead of playing it safe and making the same game over and over again with lame ass animations, same lame story, blah blah snore. if they're gonna just keep doing that, i'll gladly take more palworld please.not that the game's perfect. it needs work, and it's early access. but what's already here is great and i'm hyped for what's to come.;Recommended;680;17.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I have been saying gaming has been stagnate for so long as many of you too probably think. BUT LOOK NO FURTHER THIS IS PURE DOPAMINE AT ITS FINEST! Oh you wanna ride a dragon and blast pals while on its back? DONE. That and with its great map design along with how great it still looks even on all low setting for performance, this game is a hit for me. I mean its early access and its just so in depth, customization with pals through breeding mechanics and skill fruits (pals abilities are learned by these). like ive got a big cat dude that knows one air, fire, and water ability a piece while being ground type. I MADE AANG THE LAST AIR-BENDER AS A BUILD BRUH LIKE THIS GAME IS SO CRAZY. Also the building has a lot to be desired but its similar to valheim id say if you have played that.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Sooooo good! I am so hoping this sticks around and keeps growing. I'm having more fun on this than I've had since Valheim and Horizon Zero Dawn.The premise of the Pals (capturing them in balls, using them to help you fight or do tasks) is similar to another popular franchise, but the gameplay itself is nothing like it. This is an open world with creative aspects, resource management components, and real-time combat instead of turn-based. Not to mention, far grittier in what you're allowed to do (capturing people in pal-balls, attacking other humans, killing instead of ""fainting"" the pals, etc.) than that un-named franchise gets. The only overlap in gameplay I can really think of is team management. If you're in the mood to play this, you wouldn't be in the mood to play the other, and vice-versa. So while I see to similarities in premise, the vast differences in gameplay justify this as something completely new, imo.";Recommended;772;56.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"A lot of people summarize this game as ""Pokemon with guns"" but honestly? That comparison is just surface-level.It's more like a combination of Ark: Survival Evolved and Conan Exiles instead. Except it's better than both in a lot of ways.There's also just a pinch of Breath of the Wild in there.Overall, I enjoy it quite a bit.";Recommended;270;61.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"For a game being in Early Access, it's a solid game with some end game content in there already.Gameplay is solid and fun. I can see the Dev has some ideas around team building for your ""Pals"" team from early game.Online play experiences varies depending on how you do it.-Official Server: Can be laggy and completely full when attempt to join and stay in. Server Crashes are extremely common.-Hosting: Can be laggy depending on user connection, but it way more stable and will see less crashes.-Paid Dedicated Server: This varies depend on the price the user paid for, and their host. From what I experience, a friend brought the highest server tier and it was an extremely smooth experience for me. There were still hiccup on there: rubber-banding, lags, and server crashes. But, it was way less minimal compare to the official and other community server I'd joined.Overall, the game is off to an amazing start. I recommend it to anyone who enjoy playing action RPGs.";Recommended;804;104.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"For a game being in Early Access, it's a solid game with some end game content in there already.Gameplay is solid and fun. I can see the Dev has some ideas around team building for your ""Pals"" team from early game.Online play experiences varies depending on how you do it.-Official Server: Can be laggy and completely full when attempt to join and stay in. Server Crashes are extremely common.-Hosting: Can be laggy depending on user connection, but it way more stable and will see less crashes.-Paid Dedicated Server: This varies depend on the price the user paid for, and their host. From what I experience, a friend brought the highest server tier and it was an extremely smooth experience for me. There were still hiccup on there: rubber-banding, lags, and server crashes. But, it was way less minimal compare to the official and other community server I'd joined.Overall, the game is off to an amazing start. I recommend it to anyone who enjoy playing action RPGs.";Recommended;804;104.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;this is nothing like I thought it would be. yes, you are killing fuzzy little critters, but you didnt have to kill them. Or late least try not to. I like how it is part of 2 different games that I played. I got it and right away I couldnt leave. I recommend this game if you like crafting and harvesting and working with others and your pals;Recommended;274;15.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It is worth playingIs it a perfect game? No. Is there such a thing? Probably not. This game offers tons of stuff to explore and do. It should keep you engaged for at least 100 hours. Certainly, after a while many people might get bored with it after exploring the whole map and grinding for materials. I think for both casual and serious gamers this can provide something for everyone.Obviously, at the time of review this game is still in Early Release. Does it have bugs and random crashes?It could be better optimized for graphical performance. Most Pals don't work at the base unless you are actively there. This is something that makes me upset because if I go out exploring for days, I want to come back to a base that the pals have kept working at (mining ore, harvesting, or producing items queued up). So yes there are some things I think that can be tweaked but overall there is so much they got right.I hope you enjoy the game if you decide to pick it up. It is pretty good even if a compelling story-line (or main quest-line) is absent at this point in development. It honestly doesn't really need it, but it might be nice for some gamers.;Recommended;940;102.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"TL;DR: definitely worth the thirty bucks.Whereas other ""open world survival"" games often turn out to be a painful, irritating, grueling slog of grinding and loss,Palworld is a gleeful, exhilarating, rewarding stream of gainful progression.Palworld is like a present that you unwrap through exploring.Everywhere you look, something to find, even when you're exploring an area where you've already been again because the treasure boxes respawn after some amount of time.Even though it's not life-changing stuff, (a few gold, some bits of food, one of those silver keys, maybe a handful of consumable gear and / or schematics) it really sweetens the whole experience.Also little tidbits of resources scattered on the ground.Not to mention all the pals you will meet and tame, with the tantalizing possibility lingering that you'll land one with excellent traits.Someone on youtube described it as ""Ooh, a piece of candy... Ooh! A piece of candy ...OOH a piece of CANDY!"" and goodness were they spot-on. I have never went off on an expedition into the field and come back empty-handed. Then when I get back to base, I smooth over the frustrations of my pals with high quality food, and untangling some of their confusions. It's IMMENSELY satisfying, standing over a happy little village of happy well-fed critters all setting about the business of living the best life I can give them.And then a raid can roll in and we'll CRUSH THEM MERCILESSLY because my pals are well-trained with skills, well-leveled in power, and well-refined in rank, with well-rounded traits. The satisfaction is QUITE palpable. Heh. PAL-pable. :3So let the haters cope and seethe.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is the first survival game I've genuinely enjoyed in years. For an early access game, there's a surprising amount of content that makes it fun to play both alone or with friends. While exploring the open world, you'll find different biomes, bosses, and dungeons scattered throughout. One complaint I have though is the dungeons don't appear to be all that different from each other. They do provide a lot of resources, but there's a lack of variety in terms of how they look and how they're structured, very similar to a randomly generated Starfield planet. Given it's still Early Access though, this is likely to change at some point.In addition to the open world, the main selling point has to be the Pals. There's a good variety of different Pals to catch and more are planned to be added in the future. The way this game handles its implementation of Pals is also better than I expected. Unlike some other monster-catching games, you actually get to fight alongside your Pals and it makes for a more immersive combat experience than simply commanding your Pals to attack while you sit on the sidelines. In addition to combat, you can place your Pals at your bases to do production work and essentially have them maintain a self-sufficient farm of materials. They'll also defend your base from outsiders and raids while you're away, so you can explore without much worry as long as your base has a good foundation. This is what really makes the game unique, as there's an actual purpose for any Pals that aren't in your party aside from just being kept in a storage box. It's definitely a game I can recommend to anyone looking for a newer take on the monster-catching genre.;Recommended;1389;53.4;

Did your Charmander have a mobile flamethrower you can use? Na doubt it, Could you turn a penguin into kamikaze rocket launcher fodder? HUH? Or put a monkey squirrel on your shoulder with a SMG you can control to mow down adorable creatures for no reason at all? Fat chance. This is just the beginning of the combinations you can create early game to make your team of murdering monsters that can terrify and capture any creature you encounter as you progress around the map. It's a fun new entry to the survival crafting genre that has in my mind earned a review after 60 hours. I have spent countless laughs with friends who have dived into the purchase and even bought our own server to keep them coming. There are still plenty of bugs and issues but the devs seem to listen to the nerds with the constant updates as the game evolves. I have high hopes for Palworlds future. 8/10;Recommended;987;69.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Just downloaded game. Spent 1.5hrs on solo play. Dismantled base and now i can't build it again... Dont even want to play game now...;Not Recommended;110;7.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It scratches the gotta catch em all itch. Haven't had this much fun in a mon game since Pokemon red. It is a bit clunky but it works in all the most important places. It slows down and becomes rather grindy in the 30s but until then it is a load of fun.;Recommended;201;92.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A game that has so many bugs but aren't game breaking, it has given what people truly wanted a f2p (fun to play) experience with some cute creatures that unfortunately you can't breed yourself with them..Maybe adding an upgrade system instead of just destroying a wall then rebuild one is better and a new furnace since the current one is slow.And finally.. when is the sex update?;Recommended;315;28.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Compare it to an easy version of ARK. Then add fuzzy cartoon creatures that are comparable and some what identical to Pokemon. Next add die hard pocketmonster fan hate via online forums and what do you get. An amazing game worth its weight in the purchase you just made. While we are at it lets just add some guns. Wait what?!

Especially seeing my Pals in my base, being able to feed them, pet them and just adore them (and feeling a bit bad that my adorable hard worker never wants to take a break, I just wish I could shower her with gifts for that).

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;While the game is actually a unique and promising combination of genres which definitely shines with great potential I still would not recommend getting it right now - wait for a few major updates in the coming years before getting into it.The reason is simple - the game in its current state is plain and shallow, more on that below.Recently I went travelling around the world, trying to find something that will make me interested and give me motivation to keep playing and not to my surprise I did not encounter anything new besides more cute creatures. Every chest in the game is the same, every dungeon in the game has the same rooms and creatures, every merchant has the same stock, every wandering villager I met had the same dialogue and most of boss encounters are just enlarged versions of common pals.At first when I was just getting into it all of that seemed like a huge and interesting world, but every time I did something more than once my feeling that I'm being deceived kept increasing to the point that I actually started to dislike the game, which is pretty unfortunate for me. That's why I suggest waiting until it'll actually be filled with something, for you to not become disappointed and lose interest.If you're still looking to get the game, here is the list what the game has for now to enjoy:- Leveling and progression is somewhat doable even though it becomes a real grind later in the game- Pal gathering and pal fights are the most polished aspects in the game right now, it feels like it's working properly and it has interesting mechanics and systems built into it. The downside is the fighting where pals will just spam everything they have which spirals down to an 'aim and shoot'- Pals on base are both cool and weird, they do the job, but sometimes it's chaotic and uncontrollable- Lots of emergent behavior and cuteness overload;Not Recommended;1538;12.1;

There is building, decorating, crafting, collecting, leveling, boss fights, dungeons, achievements, etc. The music and sound effects are great. The scenery is wonderful. The pals are cute!Will the game likely hit a staling point? Sure, eventually you catch them all, but it's definitely worth the $30. price for all the fun I am having with my friends until I get to that point.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is a lot of fun and provides a variety of things to do whether you are playing by yourself or with friends. There is building, decorating, crafting, collecting, leveling, boss fights, dungeons, achievements, etc. The music and sound effects are great. The scenery is wonderful. The pals are cute!Will the game likely hit a staling point? Sure, eventually you catch them all, but it's definitely worth the $30. price for all the fun I am having with my friends until I get to that point. And I'll definitely be back to play again if they add more content after Early Access.;Recommended;481;35.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Honestly, this is one of those games where there's fun to be had for everyone in a group whether you like a more chill/calming gameplay at your base just farming and exploring or are into a more intense/action pack battles with every single pals you see. Never really played pokemon and have only seen gameplay of it but I would 1000% say that this is more ark survival/rust with slavery than anything. Overall an amazing game, no microtransactions not too much of a hassle to set up servers and just a great time with your pals and pals.100/100 Even in early access.;Recommended;466;97.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Slavery is not cool IRL, but in a video game it's amazingly fun! I've got about 80 hours in Palworld now, and thought I'd share my experience. I also, have no background with Pokemon as I'm an older gamer and that phase passed me by because I was too old to care when it got popular, but my kids loved it. This game does have visual similarities, but I think it's a great stand alone game. Although I sometimes wish the creatures were more realistic looking as I prefer that style of artistry that is closer to photo realism, but I digress. The cartoonish characters do grow on you, and have their own charm I suppose.This game is addictive. Once you play if for a few hours you'll know why. The world is massive, varied, and beautiful to look at. It does well to immerse you into the world, and creates a sense of adventure and exploration, and who doesn't like that? There are currently 113 unique Pals in the game and I still haven't even seen the majority of them. The combat is fun, challenging, and sometimes difficult, although sometimes easy as the mobs bug out and stop attacking, making it easy to capture/kill some of them, but it's not common.Since I started playing about 2 weeks ago they have updater the game several times. The Devs seem to care alot, constantly fixing bugs and upgrading AI pathing among other things. The people complaining about lag and such are correct if you are running your own server and hosting MP games. It really taxes the host PC, but the simple solution is to join another host PC, Play solo, or set up your own dedicated server. Not an option for everyone, but it's the best you can do for smooth, custom game play.Did I mention the server options? Yes, you can change many of the games internal settings via sliders and by everything I mean everything. I personally recommend turning the hunger sliders down for both the player and Pals, tuning the stamina of players and pals up slightly, and reducing the death penalty to no drops on death, as running long distances naked to recover your gear/Pals is not much fun. Managing the hunger of your slaves is also pretty boring, so like I said minimize that aspect of the game by using those slider settings, or if you like let them starve. lolBuilding a base is fun and there are crazy amounts of upgrades, but sometimes the structure building tool interface acts weird and won't allow you to place a floor, wall, roof or other item in an arera that you should be able to place it in, and sometimes it does just the opposite and lets you place them below the terrain where you can't even get to them afterward. Still this is usually avoidable by choosing a flatter area to start in. Another big problem is the tier at which some items and skills become available, as the resources to make them aren't really available early on and by the time you do get them the item has become obsolete and replaced by other better items. This is most obvious with a few of the weapons, structures, and especially the Pal specific items that allow you to mount or use a Pal's special abilities. They need to re-tier a few of these items to make them worth building. Also, completely useless is the warning bell. The AI does better at defending without it. Never build it as it can get left on work mode, or somehow switched without you knowing and your Pals will let invaders destroy your base without even flinching, and switching it back to combat mode seems to have little effect after the raid is in your camp. Feels bugged, but maybe it was me.Overall though this game is awesome and a blast to play. I started with the free Xbox version that was not updating and running an old version, then quickly bought it here on Steam and noticed vast improvement immediately, and that was at 0.1.1.0 to 0.1.2.0. It's now at 0.1.4.0 at the time of this review and even more polished. Well worth $30. Buy it. Play it. Become a slave master of cute animals today!;Recommended;3220;97.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Ignore all the haters with all their fake news BS. As someone that grew up playing the Pokemon games since Pokemon Red, this is well and truly THE DREAM POKEMON GAME WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. Sure it may look really off with the guns, the Amazon warehouse workers level of workplace violations, slavery, and war crimes, it still really is an amazing game. Albeit very glitchy and buggy at times but it still has more content and is more polished than most Early Access games out there. After sinking countless sleepless nights and almost 100 hours at the time of this review, I think I can give a simplified ""if I should buy now"" review based on your situation having experienced ALL of the following situations:Just don't read any guides and just explore and learn the game as you go. Just maybe turn off Base Raids and building damage if you don't want your dream base to go down in a blaze of glory especially if it's of a certain wooden type. I just learnt lightning bird raids love stone buildings so just turn it off unless you're totally fine with your base getting destroyed and enjoy the challenge.Solo gamer (and not interested to join others): Game is mostly very playable and without much game breaking issues. There were a few like the reset stats item but even that has been fixed. You'll have a blast with almost nothing to worry about as local games have even backup saves and cloud saves* (I think).Small PRIVATE friend group (2-4): Game is playable and with SOME game breaking issues. There are still numerous issues that can corrupt your saves like quitting guilds among others. As long as you keep your game private, you don't have to worry about the plethora of other issues. However, the host will always have to be online to resume game-play if you plan to host locally (without a dedicated server). Currently there's a lot of simple config that you can't change easily like how many bases you can build without using a very hack-ish ""UE injected mods"" which may corrupt your save file. But that won't matter much cause it's just a small group of you.";Recommended;1705;98.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game is fun, but if you're playing on a dedicated server like I was, and the host server has a blackout(due to rolling blackouts, maintenance or something out of their control) a blackout seems to corrupt the servers and it basically deletes everyone's progress. It's been well documented on forums and other areas, and basically tech support from the company is in laymen term ""oh well, its a early access, can't do anything about it, suck it."" So now me and the whole dedicated server either have to start all over AGAIN, after unlocking lvl 50 and end game, losing 200+ hours in the game, or just dropping it until the full game comes out again with stable servers....";Not Recommended;557;220.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The biggest issue i have is the random crashing while playing with my wife (It's new and in early access so I get it) Just dont get frustrated with it. Nintendo's getting mad about this game and what I have to say to that is, pokemon fans have been asking for a game like this and we were given LOA, that game changed the dynamic of pokemon and then they left it behind. I hope Palworld comes out on top of all this drama with Nintendo because to me it's a pretty exciting game to play and it's been awhile since i could sink hours into a game without even thinking about it.;Recommended;463;19.8;

Nintendo's getting mad about this game and what I have to say to that is, pokemon fans have been asking for a game like this and we were given LOA, that game changed the dynamic of pokemon and then they left it behind. I hope Palworld comes out on top of all this drama with Nintendo because to me it's a pretty exciting game to play and it's been awhile since i could sink hours into a game without even thinking about it.;Recommended;463;19.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I've been playing Pokemon for just around 10-11 years, and truth be told I've had more fun with Palworld in a week than I've had with Pokemon since I was a kid.Crafting and survival games have never really been my thing aside from Minecraft, yet I've had a blast making a small beachside base and building rooms and whatnot. The Pals have a real scale to them, which is something that Pokemon has never been able to get right. Wandering around and seeing a huge boss Pal off in the distance is really cool.That being said, of course there's some issues with the game. There really isn't enough music in my opinion, and it makes the game feel a bit too much like Breath of the Wild when there is music. Fighting wild Pals, especially once you get to a higher level, can be a real pain if you haven't put enough points into HP or Attack, because I feel like a total meat slab for Pals to annihilate.Other than that, this game is what I wish Pokemon could have become. Really fun game if you don't mind the bugs!;Recommended;820;21.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Game Review: PalworldRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)Palworld is an absolute gem in the realm of multiplayer, open-world survival and crafting games.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game is what Pokemon is supposed to be; it really highlights how lazy Nintendo has become with their IP.This game is amazing because of the nostalgia that already exists and pushes the evolution of the genre in a very authentic way.Great price, a little clunky but that comes with this type of game, worth every penny.";Recommended;267;36.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Great game, super fun both with friends and solo. As everyone says it is essentially a cross between ARK and pokemon, but it seems like you progress faster than you do with ARK since your pals will do the grindy tasks for you.;Recommended;184;14.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is fun. Currently in the early access mode there a re a few bugs, the syndicate characters dont pose any challenge even on hard mode, the camera angle when you have misdreavous around is horrible and its hard to see. The roll button is so inconvenient unlesss you have 20 fingers or a extremely flexible pinky. But even with that Id still play this game forever its the best catchem game ever. Pokemon should learn from them;Recommended;356;19.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"most pals have abilities like the ""other game"", but some have guns like how the game promoted. I'm lvl 20 and I know only about 2 pals which can hold guns (through technology (skill tab))...100+ pals and only 2 of them can hold the guns? I was hoping every one of them could hold guns...however I haven't unlocked guns on my character yet. So, hopefully later down when I unlock guns for myself sooner or later, i wish there's a technology skill which can unlock guns for every pal. Now, honestly that would be fun!";Recommended;421;41.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun, and has a lot of potential. Excited to see how this game develops. As is, its a more fun but simplified Ark, def worth trying to support the dev team!;Recommended;125;79.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Palworld is!... fun. Alright. Despite me having issues with the game, it's still a fun game to play.But for simplicity, I'll put it together like this.☆Pros☆+ An actual large world to traverse through.+ Decent bosses (and challenging, a plus for those who want a challenge).+ Solid movement for the most part. I particularly love sliding down hills.+ You can set up your base.+ Great with friends.+ Fun+Slavery C:<x-Cons-x- Despite praising the world, its functionality is a completely different beast: It's too easy to clip through the ground, slide momentum randomly stops, and Pals--and their attacks--can't seem to NOT get out of bounds. Some alpha arenas (particularly the caves) are notably bad for this.- Despite how decent the bosses are, their AI is awful. Not just their AI; every bit of the AI is terrible. The bosses become easy to abuse because some of them don't understand that a pillar is in front of them. And your pals will get stuck trying to pick up crops when all they have to do it walk to them.- The building mechanics are lackluster to me. Not to forget, it's inconsistent. For instance, you can't place floor foundation on water..., but you can on lava? I'm not against building on lava (I have a base setup around the volcanic area just for sulfur), but at least be consistent.- The final point. The pals themselves. Some designs are good and even creative! Some are bland af and uninteresting. Some are, perhaps, a little illegal. And if they were to redesign them, Pals like ""Verdash,"" ""Bushi,"" and ""Cremis"" would especially need them. What I see is grass type Cinderace, GLEAM from Yokai Watch, and a fluffier eevee.Artstyle is one thing, but copying designs? No. Be creative.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Pros:- Early-mid game is very fun and relaxing. Making progress is not a problem.- Not much problem running on HDD. Stutter only happens when going into desert area.Cons:- Capture rate doesn't feel right. 60% of capture rate can still miss 10 times in a row.- Can't build outside of the base area.- End game seems repetitive for grinding mats and XP.- Building structure is quite difficult because of the alignment and placing problem since they cannot stack together. E.g. a 2-floor staircase.;Recommended;413;81.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game is probably one of the most unoriginal games ever made... but it works, because it took all of the most amazing aspects from games like Pokemon and Ark (aswell as even Genshin Impact, i would say). The most obvious ""inspiration"" may come from Pokemon, but it just feels way better to play than any Pokemon game that was made in the last 10 years or so, even though it's still only in Early Access.I am happy that Palworld exists, even if they purely rely on the most basic and ""obvious"" path of just copying what alot of people have enjoyed from other popular games and mashing their core mechanics together. Mixing good with good to make tremendous amounts of money just seems like a genius (although scummy) idea. On the other hand, if this exact formula (Pokemon+Ark) would, in any way shape or form, already exist, this game wouldn't have been even half as successful. (Legends Arceus the closest, but not even remotely close enough)Even if the development of this game involved some of the scummiest, moneygrabbing techniques imagineable, I'm thankful for it's existance, because they basically outdid one of the most profitable gaming franchises in the world (Pokemon), who have become complacent with their infinite-moneymaking cycle of releasing the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with just a few name changes for major characters and new designs every year.Thank you Palworld!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"In an age where The Pokemon Company and Game Freak have no REAL competition in the monster catching Genre and they drop the steaming piles of sh** known as Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee and Scarlet/Violet... In their world where their technology hasn't changed in decades, a surprise challenger enters the ring and quickly CURB STOMPS them. This is Palworld and I freaking LOVE it! This is a pokemaniac's dream game.Iv'e played Pokemon since Yellow, almost from the start of it all. Yes, I'm old. Over the years, GameFreak has fallen more and more behind newer tech, and it really shows that Scarlet and Violet look like something from the OG Xbox generation and run worse than an N64 game. They don't have to care, and they don't have to try. They could literally sh** in a pokeball and sell millions of them. They are the only game in town... Well not anymore, baby!""Pokemon with guns"" was Palworld's head turning motto across the internet, but it is so much more. It's like Ark, Pokemon, Breath of the Wild and a 3rd person shooter had a baby. You can do everything you ever wanted to do in a Pokemon game and have freedoms that GameFreak would never give you. Butcher your pals for meat. Kill them, roll their corpses off a cliff for your amusement. capture humans and put them to work. Team Rocket's off to labor camp again! Base building, exploration, realtime war crimes, using the souls of dead pals to make your's stronger, dungeons, boss fights... everything.The devs have been accused of plagiarism and ripping Pokemon off, but they have given us such a better game than GameFreak ever could, and I'm fine with it. It's hard to feel sorry for the Pokemon Company here given their position and lack of innovation. Rest on your laurels long enough and someone else will beat you at your own game.The game does have some bugs, as expected in early access. The most common ones I see is that pals will be inside rock formations or under the map, and pathing for the AI is durpy. Even on perfectly flat open terrain, the AI can just stand there and have a stroke, jiggling around not knowing what to do. Also, sometimes pals spawn in your base and get stuck and starve, because they can't open doors or pathfind themselves down stairs. I hope these get fixed. It's like when my old tomagatchi fell behind my dresser as a kid. That thing starved to death alone in the dark. R.I.PConsidering that I'm running a UE5 game on an old GTX 1070, performance is decent. The game does have stuttering issues, even on a 7,500MB/s SSD, but most Unreal Engine games do. I hope they find a fix for that. The only other real negative I can think of right now is that I wish I had a way to keep the giant green mammoths from getting in the way of my base every two seconds.

R.I.PConsidering that I'm running a UE5 game on an old GTX 1070, performance is decent. The game does have stuttering issues, even on a 7,500MB/s SSD, but most Unreal Engine games do. I hope they find a fix for that. The only other real negative I can think of right now is that I wish I had a way to keep the giant green mammoths from getting in the way of my base every two seconds. Pretty annoying.Palworld has me addicted. Time to go back to it.";Recommended;2311;33.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Best Early Access i have played. A few bugs and glitches but it is to be expected, i have not crashed a single time in 65 hours.Nice big update with bugfixes just launched too. 10/10;Recommended;148;77.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Short summary after 2 weeks of playing:- Fun loop, good to have a way to keep bases self-sustainable- Combat is good and tactical enough, although melee is weak. Probably expected considering guns later on- The map is huge! And there's little to no places where the world feels empty. there's always something, let it be Pals roaming or chests/eggs/effigies to find- Lots of little things done right, like each Pal serving a purpose in several ways, fast travel points not being that far apart, and each wild Pal having different personalities (some flee when they see you, some attack you if you attack their brethren, some attack on sight)- Some minor bugs here and there, like sound bugs or Pals getting stuck, or pathing issues, some silly ragdoll issues. Had a few crashes (AMD GPU related) but it seems to have been fixed.- Start is slow, as mentioned from other reviewers, but it's not a big deal, and a non-issue in multiplayer.- Starting areas do have same-ish Pals at start, so don't expect your beginning to change too much unless you go out of your way to do it- First boss is a bit of a difficulty spike, and next bosses you won't fight for a long time after that.- The devs are communicating well so far. Let's hope it continues well after this.Overall, this is a high recommendation from me. Worth the money for sure even at this stage. And with the roadmap showing they have a nice plan like adding more pals or islands and crafting stuff, the future so far is very bright for this game.Are there stuff to be fixed or addressed? Yes. But as it currently stands in 0.1.4, things are looking great.;Recommended;1325;155.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Really excited for the future of this game, been enjoying it thus far. For those that are considering buying this game I'm very confident you will enjoy it, but if you have any doubts I'd give it a few months to see how everything plays out.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is good, really good even. Sure, it's not particularly original or innovative in a lot of various categories. But at the end of the day, what this game does really well is stringing it's inspirations together in a rather well polished package. (Well, as well polished as you could expect an early access survival craft game could be.) The interaction between the monster collecting system with the survival base building is phenomenal. These systems are woven together so that you want to go collect more monsters so that you can build up your base, but then you also want to build up your base to help you further explore and collect newer and stronger monsters.I do think the game really grinds to a halt come post 50 hours, or around the level 40 range. In order to get to a full complete play through of this game, there will be some point where your progression will really slow down. It was a slog to get across the finish line, but at the end of the day I still really had a good ass time with this game. I think this could end up getting improved by fleshing out the tech tree later on, but eh. Is what it is at this current time.There's a lot of potential here to be so much more. But I wouldn't bank your purchase on the premise of it becoming the next mega-franchise. But, for $30 this game provides an immense amount of entertainment.;Recommended;1106;98.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Highly recommend if you enjoy survival games and or monster taming games. It leans more on the monster taming side at the moment. Their is a hunger meter but it's an easy solve.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;https://GameOver.ReviewsThe Good:PALWORLD emerges as a captivating and delightful adventure, ideal for both solo and group play. The base-building component strikes an enjoyable balance between fun and complexity, especially with the intriguing challenge of gravity. The PvE raids add an extra layer of excitement to the experience. The heart of the game lies in the intricate process of capturing, collecting, and managing Pals, which becomes increasingly rewarding as players advance. The game's visual appeal and exploration elements are standout features. Ascending to new heights with a flying Pal is an unmatched experience, offering a fresh perspective on the game's expansive world.The Bad:However, PALWORLD is not without its drawbacks. Combat may at times feel a bit monotonous and formulaic, and newcomers might struggle to track down quests. The death penalty can be a source of frustration, but this can be mitigated in a private server setting, such as the ones provided by ShockByte. For those seeking guidance on server settings, our tech video series on server management for PALWORLD on ShockByte can be a valuable resource. Being an Early Access game, it's also worth noting that PALWORLD has its share of glitches that need addressing.Is it Game Over ...So, is it game over for PALWORLD? Far from it. This title is a strong contender in the gaming world, deserving a place in your collection. With its unique blend of engaging gameplay, challenging mechanics, and visually striking environments, PALWORLD offers hours of entertainment at a reasonable price point. The game stands proudly with a rating of 4 out of 5 hearts on gameover.reviews. It's not just the current gameplay that excites, but also the vast potential the game holds, especially with the possibilities of future modifications. Despite its current imperfections, PALWORLD is a game that promises ongoing fun and adventure, making it a worthwhile addition for any gamer.;Recommended;1653;31.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;https://GameOver.ReviewsThe Good:PALWORLD emerges as a captivating and delightful adventure, ideal for both solo and group play. The base-building component strikes an enjoyable balance between fun and complexity, especially with the intriguing challenge of gravity. The PvE raids add an extra layer of excitement to the experience. The heart of the game lies in the intricate process of capturing, collecting, and managing Pals, which becomes increasingly rewarding as players advance. The game's visual appeal and exploration elements are standout features. Ascending to new heights with a flying Pal is an unmatched experience, offering a fresh perspective on the game's expansive world.The Bad:However, PALWORLD is not without its drawbacks. Combat may at times feel a bit monotonous and formulaic, and newcomers might struggle to track down quests. The death penalty can be a source of frustration, but this can be mitigated in a private server setting, such as the ones provided by ShockByte. For those seeking guidance on server settings, our tech video series on server management for PALWORLD on ShockByte can be a valuable resource. Being an Early Access game, it's also worth noting that PALWORLD has its share of glitches that need addressing.Is it Game Over ...So, is it game over for PALWORLD? Far from it. This title is a strong contender in the gaming world, deserving a place in your collection. With its unique blend of engaging gameplay, challenging mechanics, and visually striking environments, PALWORLD offers hours of entertainment at a reasonable price point. The game stands proudly with a rating of 4 out of 5 hearts on gameover.reviews. It's not just the current gameplay that excites, but also the vast potential the game holds, especially with the possibilities of future modifications. Despite its current imperfections, PALWORLD is a game that promises ongoing fun and adventure, making it a worthwhile addition for any gamer.;Recommended;1653;31.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I'm gonna be real here... I've curved the ""edge"" that this game gives off, which is ""P*****n but darker and with guns"" because, even though I do enjoy it for that and the memes that's made with it, There is just SO much more to this game than that.The Pals are just such a treat. They're the most enjoyable part of this game for me hands-down. to hell with the people who hate them because of their derivative nature, because even Game Freak copies off of themselves when designing new porkaymans. Tell me, how many pikachus are there now? there's pikachu, pikachu but baby, pikachu but twins, pikachu but squirrel, pikachu but flying squirrel, pikachu but short... like, come on.The gameplay is a breath of fresh air compared to Packermoon's stagnant turn-based hot mess. when I'm shooting at the local wildlife, I'm not really doing it for the lols, I'm doing it because I'm hunting for materials, or I need to level up, or I need to defend myself from aggro'd pals. I get into the mindset of playing BotW/TotK and ARK, rather than what most poeple think of when they play this game, because when the edge factor and hilarity fades, you get to play this game on its own merits, and it's fekkin incredible.I'm kinda glad this game doesn't have a story yet, because it makes me feel like I can insert my own story into this game. There's no time limit, no objective, no urgency... you just get to chill with your pals, and build a magnificent base. Sure, you could be the most god awful person and work your pals to death, and I don't have anything against people who do that, lol. But I don't really go that far. I like to work with my pals, pet my pals, help them out when their sanity is low, watch in awe as Dinossom bathes with the cutest dance, like holy ♥♥♥ they're adorable.I can't wait to see how amazing this game gets as it updates.

Personally, I did really enjoy my time playing, but I just cant bring myself to recommend it, but I also don't want to give it a thumbs down either, if steam had some sort of neutral option I suppose I'd give it that.TLDR, the game is both good and bad, right now in its early state I wouldn't recommend but definitely keep your eye on it for future updates and maybe try it then.";Not Recommended;629;59.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;For an early access game, it's a huge surprise. It's already more fleshed out, stable and polished than the ♥♥♥♥ big studios put out and it has a large amount of content. It's not perfect, there's some pathing issues and such, but if this is what the first release in early access looks like, it'll be great when it's done. It's fun, it's what people want and hoped for and it's already better than Pokemon could ever hope to be.;Recommended;350;63.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Not sure if there's much point in recommending the game given seemingly everyone I know is already playing it. That said, if you like survival and building games. That's basically what it is. Just has some monster collecting aspects to it and a lot of other stuffs. One thing I'd take note of is that this is nothing like the popular game it's being compared to. It kind of reminds me of Monster Hunter Stories and Minecraft the most. Though, it's fair to say there's a lot of elements similar to Ark, Fortnight and so on.For an Early Access title, it's pretty solid as is. Even if it isn't finished. That said, the building is very basic. The breeding, capture and battling is smooth and fairly straight forward. Game is more than worth the asking price in my opinion. Even if there's still a lot more work that's going to be done to the game. Would note, the story is also solid, though kind of obscured. I'm very interested in seeing what they make of it once the game reaches completion.;Recommended;811;121.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I will start this off and say. This game is amazing and the only thing I will say negative is that I spent my whole week off playing this game and it just happened that way!!! I took a week off and on day one I heard about this game and decided to buy it. I regret it as my time off fro work is almost over but at the same time I am so thankful I got into this game.I got to say at its current moment in the games life time, i would say play this solo and get use to it at your own pace, and then once this game is cleaned up a bit more hop into multiplayer servers. But really it doesn't matter the game is fun and hits in a certain way that just feels refreshing to someone who was looking for just something Fun.Lastly the game is worth the 30 dollars, and if you still don't have it and notice a sale BUY IT! You will not regret it.;Recommended;661;41.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;For an early access game, it's a huge surprise. It's already more fleshed out, stable and polished than the ♥♥♥♥ big studios put out and it has a large amount of content. It's not perfect, there's some pathing issues and such, but if this is what the first release in early access looks like, it'll be great when it's done. It's fun, it's what people want and hoped for and it's already better than Pokemon could ever hope to be.;Recommended;350;63.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Not sure if there's much point in recommending the game given seemingly everyone I know is already playing it. That said, if you like survival and building games. That's basically what it is. Just has some monster collecting aspects to it and a lot of other stuffs. One thing I'd take note of is that this is nothing like the popular game it's being compared to. It kind of reminds me of Monster Hunter Stories and Minecraft the most. Though, it's fair to say there's a lot of elements similar to Ark, Fortnight and so on.For an Early Access title, it's pretty solid as is. Even if it isn't finished. That said, the building is very basic. The breeding, capture and battling is smooth and fairly straight forward. Game is more than worth the asking price in my opinion. Even if there's still a lot more work that's going to be done to the game. Would note, the story is also solid, though kind of obscured. I'm very interested in seeing what they make of it once the game reaches completion.;Recommended;811;121.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I will start this off and say. This game is amazing and the only thing I will say negative is that I spent my whole week off playing this game and it just happened that way!!! I took a week off and on day one I heard about this game and decided to buy it. I regret it as my time off fro work is almost over but at the same time I am so thankful I got into this game.I got to say at its current moment in the games life time, i would say play this solo and get use to it at your own pace, and then once this game is cleaned up a bit more hop into multiplayer servers. But really it doesn't matter the game is fun and hits in a certain way that just feels refreshing to someone who was looking for just something Fun.Lastly the game is worth the 30 dollars, and if you still don't have it and notice a sale BUY IT! You will not regret it.;Recommended;661;41.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is great. Game play is a lot more like Ark than Pokemon which is good. The game also allows players to do many things games now a days wouldn't dare to do. Game isn't too hard or too bad grindy either. Though there does need to be some work in certain areas but, with how well the game is selling and doing,hopefully the updates will keep coming and keep making it better. Game has a lot of potential and with the amount of sales, the company should be able to really make this game shine even better hopefully. Looking forward to all the content coming in the future.Fans of Pokemon and Ark should love or at the very least like this game.No harm no foul if it's not for you either.~sincerely,A Fellow Pal Tamer.;Recommended;588;20.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;What Can I really say that hasn't been already said about this game?Palworld is a survival crafting game, with creature capturing and base building. It's an Early Access game and yet, it's got more polish than most AAA games that have released in the last decade all while being a third of the price with ZERO microtransactions. The devs deserve all the success in the world for this game as it's catering to what a large audience has wanted for years and went completely ignored by a certain company who makes a somewhat similar game with far less care and polish....Pros:Open world exploration which is mostly good but not perfect, a lot of dead spots with nothing but it's 8/10Creature capturing and training, It's fun though the capture rates really don't make much sense nor do they really seem to match their %rates. 7/10Base building, it's fun but a bit simple 6.5/10Polish level, Again it's early access but it's actually fairly decent. 7.5/10Music, Not great, but nice 6.5/10graphics: Cute art style that has some dark undertones to match the games theme 8/10Overall rating for Palworld in it's current state 8/10Please keep improving this game, it's so much fun and I look forward to seeing it grow and improve!Cheers;Recommended;1020;53.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Do I recommend... HELL YEAH. This is the best thing to come out of Pokemon since Pokemon Legends Arceus. To all the people on twitter who are trembling saying ""Nintendo-chan you... you need to sue them sue them now!"" are dumb 10 year old's who don't realize that the last time Pokemon was good was when they were 1 years old when gen 5 came out. The last two good games Pikachu was in were Pokemon Legends Arceus and Smash Ult. I think Palworld is the only thing that is going to hold Game Freak to a slandered because if not Diddo better be ready to be the only Pokemon left because he can turn in to a Pal.Sorry about the rant, but I do recommend this to any Pokemon fan over the age of 11 because you want to play a good Pokemon game but there are not any from the past 9 years.";Recommended;627;9.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Graphic is good, gameplay is fun (the combat gets boring after you play a long time, base building is basic, pal automaton is okay, finding and capturing new pal is very fun tho), story is meh (play this game for the gameplay not the story), and soundtrack is okay.For early access, there's surprisingly lots of stuff to do (for beginner, not endgame).For endgame, i think there's only 3 stuff you can do1. Getting the pal you want (by breeding or capturing, also for 10 pal completion).2. Base building (improving base, making a new base)3. Grinding for legendary gear.For me, they get boring very fast.And finally the bugs. There's lots of bugs in this game. As i'm writing this review, here's some bugs i've encountered.1. Pal not working because its stuck/on top of something (this is by far the most annoying one because it is very common to happen).2. Pal capture rate is lower if you upgrade your capture rate (this can be slightly fixed if you increase the pal capture rate on the world settings).3. Item drop for butchering Pal fall through the ground (so don't bother with butchering mechanic).4. Some Pal and human enemy AI wont attack you and just standing still.5. Losing some item on the storage if you destroy the storage (i'm guessing it's also fall through the ground).6. If you get wanted level, the police/military will just teleport to you (this is ridiculous, it's cyberpunk 2077 all over again).7. I'm not sure if its a bug or the game design, but every Pal that is working on the base is only working if you're also on the same base. If you fast travel to somewhere else, they are still working but it seems they work on a slower pace/not working at all.8. Stuttering very badly if you look a certain direction (it's not only last a few seconds, it's around 2-10 minutes of heavy stuttering).And the rest is more of a visual bugs, stuff not loaded, etc.I personally can handle and ignore most of those bugs, but if you have very little patience or easily irritated, then you might want to wait untill they fixed most of them.Hopefully the devs are quick at fixing those bugs and adding more endgame content soon.For the price, it is very worth it. Buy it before they add more content and probably increasing the price. 8/10.;Recommended;1852;128.6;

Buy it before they add more content and probably increasing the price. 8/10.;Recommended;1852;128.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is excellent. I haven't enjoyed a game like this in years.Combat is fun and dynamic, not too grindy and rewarding.Pals are well designed and interesting, from the starting area up until the endgame they're all great.;Recommended;185;33.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is still in early access, so its crazy how big its getting. This might be the most fun I have had in a game in years. Zelda breath of the Wild, pokemon, ark all mashed in one. Still its own game, fresh and amazingAs most games go unless new fresh content is being released often it has the potential to slowly loose traction and die out. That is ok. In early access its $20 or so. 30 hours in since I got it 5 days ago and it was worth it even if they never release anything for the game after,;Recommended;398;31.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;pokemon with guns. overall a good and fun game. yet the game still have some performance issue that need to be fixed after the full release and some bug and fix. but i really enjoy with the game.;Recommended;158;29.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Tons of fun. If you like Ark and games like it and also Pokemon then you will love this. Don't listen to people talking about it being a copy of anything, its original enough on it's own. It's early access so obviously still stuff to be added and things to be fixed,, but very fun and worth your time and money.;Recommended;251;98.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's real-time Pokemon battling in an immersive open world. What's not to like? It would be nice if the game had a real story and more ability to skip the survival elements if you wanted a more traditional Pokemon-like experience, but it's really a blast.

Definitely recommend, and can't wait to see where it goes in Early Access!;Recommended;384;16.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I really like this game- and that's saying something considering how picky I can be, and I also am not a giant fan of ""Survival"" games... or at least I think so, not so sure anymore after playing this game.It has fun RPG elements while capturing monsters, base building, making saddles for almost any creature that you can ride or get a special ability like Lifmunk getting a submachine gun.There is also guns, factions fighting for control (I think) and you can challenge their leaders to a fight while they use a super rare monster.There is a lot here, and the game is in early access, so there are quite a bit of glitches, but it doesnt ruins the game- at least for me anyways.";Recommended;556;45.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is some true pokemon competition in some of the best ways possible and hopefully pushes that company to explore the limits of game mechanics and creativity. Unfortunately whether its the powers of nintendo or some unloved individuals official servers are still plagued with cheaters and those who wish to take their sad excuses of lives out on others instead of enjoying life. Highly recommend and tell your friends, lets make palworld the biggest game of our generation. aside from the cheating on official servers its 10/10 when coop'ed with friends. give it a shot and hopefully we can enjoy the game without trolls, cheaters, and poor excuses for humans.;Recommended;554;82.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;this is a game that has monsters called pals that are like pokemon or digimon, but are NOT pokemon or digimon. they're pals. anyway, you catch them, enslave them in a pal box at your base that you create, and make them work for you by tending crops, crafting weapons, armor and other various things, and fending off enemies. you can collect a ♥♥♥♥ ton, or sell them to pal merchants, slaughter them, or combine them into stronger versions. you can breed them to make other pals. you can fly them. you can ride them. I don't think i ever played a pokemon game where you can ride the pokemon. anyway, it's pretty fun to play until all your ♥♥♥♥ gets erased in your dedicated server because your computer randomly restarted.PROSyou get to see many cool creaturesyou get to beat stuff upyou get to shoot pals in the faceyou get to capture pals in pretty ballsyou get to make stuffyou get to make foodyou get to run a farmyou get to craft weaponyou get to fly/ride pals across a vast world with several biomesyou get to breed palsyou get to create palsyou get to fight bossesCONSnovelty wears off after 80 hoursNOWHERE does it tell you that you need to manually back up your dedicated server because yours and your friends bases and everything you have will be GONE if the power goes out in your house or your computer randomly restartsall my ♥♥♥♥ is gone because my computer randomly restarted during the nightit's basically having a plantation and being a slaver of adorable creatures with magic powers;Recommended;1233;123.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;this is a game that has monsters called pals that are like pokemon or digimon, but are NOT pokemon or digimon. they're pals. anyway, you catch them, enslave them in a pal box at your base that you create, and make them work for you by tending crops, crafting weapons, armor and other various things, and fending off enemies. you can collect a ♥♥♥♥ ton, or sell them to pal merchants, slaughter them, or combine them into stronger versions. you can breed them to make other pals. you can fly them. you can ride them. I don't think i ever played a pokemon game where you can ride the pokemon. anyway, it's pretty fun to play until all your ♥♥♥♥ gets erased in your dedicated server because your computer randomly restarted.PROSyou get to see many cool creaturesyou get to beat stuff upyou get to shoot pals in the faceyou get to capture pals in pretty ballsyou get to make stuffyou get to make foodyou get to run a farmyou get to craft weaponyou get to fly/ride pals across a vast world with several biomesyou get to breed palsyou get to create palsyou get to fight bossesCONSnovelty wears off after 80 hoursNOWHERE does it tell you that you need to manually back up your dedicated server because yours and your friends bases and everything you have will be GONE if the power goes out in your house or your computer randomly restartsall my ♥♥♥♥ is gone because my computer randomly restarted during the nightit's basically having a plantation and being a slaver of adorable creatures with magic powers;Recommended;1233;123.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Runs better then ark does and is more fun than Pokemon in my opinion.;Recommended;56;67.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's a refreshed version of the Open World Pokemon Games. It's much more serious in terms of the realism that can be shown in the game. First is the real world weapons. Second is the exploration and the push towards actually needing to explore the world instead of making it optional. In the Pokemon Games there are many optional places you can go to if u want to, but in Palworld it feels like you need to discover the whole map to find certain Pals and to try and find the best base spots. Third is the more realistic behavior people can have towards Pals and other people. Who says I can't just use Moltres or Zapdos to absolutely obliterate a cop or to help me capture a trainer? That's possible in Palworld and gives another possible objective in the game (catching all merchants and black marketeers). People can also be very creative with the building of the bases and how to have their Pals help them in those bases. In Pokemon, the pokemon can't be used for anything other from battles. Also, Pokemon needs to just be harder game in general to try and compete with Palworld. Even though you can put everything to the lowest setting in Palworld and play like that, it feels like Pokemon over the years just became the lowest difficulty possible in a video game. I wouldn't be surprised if the new Pokemon games add a survival aspect to their games. Also Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is just a PS2 game on the Switch. How can BOTW be that much better graphically and then playing Pokemon Scarlet & Violet is like playing OSRS. Absolutely unbelievable.;Recommended;1276;107.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;10/10 game and is very addicting. There are a-lot of creatures to discover with a large map to explore. The Devs seem to know what they are doing and what they are planning sounds great. I recommend playing on a home server or solo for now though because there is a strong possibility your progress might get reset unexpectedly if you play public. Plus you can control how grindy the game is with world settings.;Recommended;338;46.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fantastic game. Literally feels like Ark and Pokemon had a baby, and took the best parts from both games.This game has a lot of potential, can't wait to see where it goes. Really looking forward to new pal additions, new maps, and more to do in each area.The game feels a bit empty, but for the price point, it's WAY more content than I expected.;Recommended;282;36.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"It's a downgraded ARK.It's by no means a ""bad game"", but is entirely derivative, and the gameplay becomes tedious after level 25-30. The only reasonable way to level in the game is by catching Pok-...Pals, of which the process does not change outside of the ways they can hit you. The bosses are essentially the same thing except you kill them instead of catching them.Hopefully they can add some more nuance to the gameplay in the future and more reasons to be excited about leveling up.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"so not sure how end end game is but close to end game is very fun. Make sure to automate a bunch of resource farms so u can go pew pew with all the boom sticks. There is a ton of settings to make the game as easy or difficult as you want. It is early access though; i really really hope they add some sort of character save mechanic so you can keep your inventory and level when swapping to friends worlds. I love the early game and all but don't really wanna spend the 80+ hours to farm it back up on my friends world. Would highly recommend overall, at a good price point and can easily give at least 200 hours of fun (okay maybe 25% of that is holding down F)";Recommended;528;90.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A little rough around the edges and leveling kind of slows to a crawl when you hit about level 30, but overall it's a ton of fun and it's way better than anything Pokemon has put out recently!;Recommended;155;65.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Yeah, it's good.At the time of writing this, it has sold over 19 mii. Once it hits 24 mil in a few days it will have outsold every Pokemon game except for the original red+blue/green.Don't come into this thinking its a monster catcher though. Its more like Ark but they replaced all the dinosaurs with Kirkland brand Pokemon.;Recommended;268;55.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is definitely a breath of fresh air, very exciting, challenging and over all energetic and fun to play for hours to come, the designs are also very innovating the level of detail is also very amazing, the character designs, and PALs are all unique and adorable to work with, it definitely does give the vibes of Pokemon but with so many other game elements mixed in to make an entire original game, to me is addicting but over all fun to play, I can't wait to see what the finalize version of this great game will offer, this is a very exciting experience I get every time I get on to play.;Recommended;487;35.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A fun game that takes a lot of hints from the titans of the past. I enjoy the visual similarities with the new gameplay.;Recommended;97;13.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"So, first of all, this Game is still in a Early State, keep that in Mind and it may contain some Spoilers for Very New Player.After seeing a buckload of comparission to Pokemon i can say, Foxsparks looks like Vulpix? You Drunk? And a Wolf looks like.. a Wolf?! OMG! But Jokes aside now, time for a real feedback.The Game is a Combination of Survival, Shooter, RPG, Sandbox to me.The Graphics are pretty good looking and the Map feels kinda Huge on the first exploration.Personally i like the Breeding-System, its Simple but pretty extensive on the numbers of combinations, but the good part is, you dont have to wait for 1 Egg, you can just wait and let them continue (with enough Cake) and collect more if u want to have more of the same type, really liked that!And the Simple part is, the Pals get part of each Parent or sometimes random Perks, so it's easy with enough time to breed Perfect.(But hey every Pal can learn Basicly every attack through the Fruits)Some Bugs of the Early state are Frustating, like glitching into the ground, the air, the Walls or Pals Glitching outside the Base or Underground, but after seeing the Patch for the Weightlimit, that you dont stand like Like a Rock when you are Overloaded i am pretty Positive it get fixed in the Future.I think it could need a general Change on the weight of some items, like all ""selling-Items"" weight 0 but just one other weights 10 each?Ah and on Server the Delay is horrific, like you catch something and it still cast an Attack in the ball or before it breaks out again, so you aint have time to do anything against it (and it had just 17ms).But some Gamebreaking Bugs like when you get unlimited Spheres but can't attack in returnAnother Stupifd thing is, if you Attack a NPC you get a ""Wanted"" and they ""chase"" or Rather Spawn in a set distance to you, no matter where you are, even in a Dungeon!The Character-Stats could be made better too, like Attack is wasted totally if you go for Ranged Weapons, but Weight is so important not to Level, same is Endurance, you get out of breath like for 5 seconds Sprinting or 3 seconds gliding early on.The Catch-Rate is kinda bad tho, it could need a bit more accuracy, and the ""Lifmunk""-Bonus could be added to the Base before you Throw the Ball instead after.The Vendors could be revamped a bit too, instead Resetting after each teleport, they could reset like each new Day, but thats just Personal thoughts.The Building-System has so much room to grow.Like Corner-Walls or Corner-Roofs, half walls horizontally and vertically or more variations on the foundation like a triangle so you can have a bit smoother Walls, and more Possibility to build like stairs upwards or downwards or in generall more placed you can build, i would like to have more space to go over a clip instead 1 foundation (if possible at all) and a option to remove the Pillars of the foundation, so it doesnt hanging randomly in the air, kinda looks ugly to me)The Big walls could have like a connecting point so you can place them better.And more, more, more Building options, like a Elevator or stuff, like i Said it has so much Room to grow on this Part.But it's nice that aslong you have Items stored in Chests it will be used to crafting inside your Pal-Box Range, so no searching in every Box for Stuff.The AI could need a bit of a Change or a way of assigning Pals to direct works and keep them doing it (not just throw them there and sometime they stop completely)And the Invading Events are horrible, even if you catch a Pal there if the ""hidden Timer"" runs out before its shown, you just catch nothing, it doesn't care if there is currently a catch going on.If the Inventory is full, the Items you obtain like from a Catch should just lay on the ground instead of just disappearing into a void.I haven't done Endgame Raids so i can't say much on that Part.-Pretty Big Map-Simple but extensive Breeding-Alot of time you can Invest without getting Bored-Pretty OK Building System-Possibility to Grow a lot on many Parts-Fast keeping up on Fixing the Game-Many Combination Possibilitys with Skills and Pals-Pretty Good Graphic-Weapons *Pew Pew*-Bugs and Glitches-Building Opportunitys-Catch-System is pretty bad right now-Character Stats are unbalanced-Not so good Character-Editor-AI sometime is kinda Bad-Nothing to grow Inventory Space-Invading Events are bad";Recommended;3594;137.7;

This game is *fun*, it liberally takes ideas from successful games, but it meshes them in a really enjoyable way, creating a survival lite experience with a fun taming/breeding element and unexpectedly enjoyable gunplay. This won't be a game of the year on most lists as there's no real story, but their monsters are enjoyable, the game world is pretty, and immediately after launch they began taking action to respond to playerbase requests.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;game is fun, needs more customization for key commands, like an inventory key so we can go straight to inventory. also fix things like stairs. cant connect them to my home, so i have to jump in. adding boats or something so we can make a base over water. or some sort of underwater base, caves ect.;Recommended;242;31.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"little rough in some area but hella fun i don't know why. And this is coming from someone who could not get into Ark survival . Maybe its having pocket monsters with good'ole american pass times added. what i can say this game is addicting. like Asmon balding you ask for more, correction you want more.Seeing the potential of a pocket monster game that doesn't rely on tropes like ""power of friendship"" but instead sweat, tears and a 10ft electric Mouse wielding a Gatling pew pew is a breath of fresh air and napalm.Palworld is possibly every pocket monster fans wet dream but with chemical X added.";Recommended;495;22.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Product refundedThis game is basically ARK + Pokemon. My only major critique is it is clearly plagiarising content from both those franchises and turning them into a great game. Hard to know if this is what the future of gaming in but for now just enjoy the ride;Recommended;215;0.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This isn't really my genre of game to not say the name of the franchise this is taken from but I got the chance to try this game, and for the most I'd say I found it surprisingly fun !A few noteworthy plus :- The multiplayer seems very stable !- It has pretty graphics and nice OST even if it could use more tracks for variety.- The pals are cute. Their stats, abilities system, traits, etc... is very nifty.- The survival part doesn't take too much space and has plenty customization.It's not representative of all the good things in this game, that will be to each their owns.But now, the reason why I'm leaving a negative review. The game is hardly playable without running into constant problems we're all gonna share :- The pals pathfinding is bugged, constantly. They will run into each others, for minutes at times. Or because of structures, walls, seemlingly nothing ? Unable to do most basic tasks. This makes building extremely boring because it needs to be taken into account to a serious degree.- Combats can be very unbalanced because your Pals will try to find the exact pixel to position themselves on before attacking, if the opponent moved... ♥♥♥♥ ! Must pathfind again.- There are many out of bound problems, I load under the map almost every times. A Pal escape capture ? Might as well release it behind the walls of a cave.- There isn't just collision bugs of course. I usually end up my sessions because of a crash. I often can't see my friends on the map despite being in the same guilds. And the HUD of shops have infoscreen that shows only after purchasing (curious way to tempt customers) and at times I need to press a purchase button despite having selected nothing before being able to browse.- When it's not bugs, it's the gameplay. The map has the roughest edges detection I've ever seen, making exploring on a mount super complicated when they can't make most of their jumps.- Caves are extremely uninspired and repetitive, there would be potencial for a lot of variety but each of them seems 1/1 identical with barely shifting room connections.Voilà... from what I could recall.It's just sad really, to run into rushed key elements at so many occasions. I'm really tempted to continue, but that will be when the game see fixes. I do keep my hopes up so my best wishes to the developpers.;Not Recommended;1908;23.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Play this game. The world is massive and the Pals are many. I also appreciate how much you can customize the difficulty settings. This is the most fun $30 will ever buy you.;Recommended;141;44.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Great game, even at it's early access state. On the surface Palworld looks like just another Pokemon clone, but it's so much more. First off, I'm not a diehard Pokemon fan, I've played a half a dozen or so but never completed any. However I thoroughly enjoy open world/sandbox/builder/survival games and have several thousands of hours in these type games.What i really like about Palworld is the freedom to play the game the way you want to play and you get a sense of achievement no matter what you choose to do. The difficulty scales according to what you choose to do. You can play the core gameplay loop, bop pals and throw spheres, trying to catch them all, or rack up boss captures/kills. Casually stroll through the game or push your skills to the limit. Then there is the meta game, advancing your pals through cross breeding, condensing, pal souls, skill fruit and accessories. The game is easy to play and challenging to master.There are some warts though. The art isn't consistent or doesn't seem to have any core aesthetic. It feels like they could make a pass on all the models and texture (aside from the pals which are great), and get a look and feel that is more cohesive and less like it was farmed out or purchased from and asset house. There are a lot of minor bugs, occasional a major one and some game balancing issues that need addressing, but for an EA game it is pretty solid. For $27 you can't go wrong. Buy the game, get past level 20 and the game really opens up.;Recommended;1220;178.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;So, just for your information.Don’t use Digtoise at your mining farm. I repeat, do NOT use this MOTHERF*CKER at your mining farm.“But Tali, I barely know you, meanwhile all CoNTEnT cReATuRs say he is a beast!”Well, no, Digtoise SUCKS at mining. Digtoise’s only beneficial trait is that, when YOU summon him from your team he will decently mine some ore nodes.However, when put into the ranch, the damage output he does to ore nodes is heavily nerfed, from 30/35 to F*CKING 1/2 per hit, which makes him WORSE than Dumud, Tombat, Anubis and basically any other freaking Pal with Mining level 2 or more.Not only that, but this STUPID ARSHOLE TURTLE eats A LOT, every 1 or 2 spins it will stop his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ work and go eat, then repeat the same routine, making his stupidly slow mining speed even WORSE.Just to put some numbers and evidence into perspective, Anubis, he eats around 1 time per 35 ores mined. Reptyro 1 per 25. Dumud eats around 1 per 20.This stupid turtle eats arround 10 TIMES PER 30, 3 F*CKING ORES AND THEN EATS.So, stop recomending Dicktoise as a mining farmer, cause he is not, he sucks and should never be used in your base.;Recommended;937;107.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Very enjoyable once you get the hang of things and the mechanics, especially given that there are many bugs/glitches. Glad that the devs are putting in the work to update the bugs! Two updates since the release which has fixed A LOT! <3;Recommended;194;32.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;PalWorld is super fun especially if you're cool with needing to mine for resources to build/upgrade tools and base items. The capture mechanic is quick and fun to do and the variety of Pals is pretty good also with many creature and element types, including different abilities that are useful inside and out of battle. Being early access means the game is not without it's issues with many including crashing, pal pathing problems, map mesh issues and a lack of a proper story or any real motivation aside from capturing pals and beating the towers. Their are legendary status Pals and various things to do, one is collecting diary entries that provide some story similar to finding the notes in Ark Survival Evolved.;Recommended;596;12.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Did you ever want to fly on the back of a giant bird, shooting a musket and catching creatures mid flight? That's the reality of this game.Nintendo and Nintendo Fanboys alike are seething that they slept on making an actually good Pokemon game- Palworld beat them to it. It's not ""Pokemon with guns"", it's better than anything Pokemon has done for 15+ years. It's FUN Ark with Anime animals, a robust feeling of progression, and insane mechanics. I should say to the developers - try and make it your own! Don't make this game any less unique by emulating, say, the piano sounds from BOTW. Yes, you have the right to use similar sounds - but you want to have your players feel the feeling and hear the sounds they can ONLY get from Palworld. Make the ancient tech and glowing towers purple and green instead of blue! That way your players won't think ""oh this is just like _____"" -you don't want that. you want your players to only think of your game when they your game!This game is fun, and relatively polished for being 1 month into early access! I simply cannot believe how insane and over the top the programming is for the Pals in base. The way you need different elements and types of helpers to automate your tasks is just incredible. The designs are fresh and cute, the names are all over the board crazy and i'm here for it. Fuack???

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I really love the game but the only issue that really upsets me, and by upset I mean makes me sad, is I can not play this game with my online friends who are all in a guild. Because the game only allows 3 palboxes and my friends already have 2 of the palboxes down for mining ores and one palbox down that is cluttered with machinery for gear and items. There's no where to build inside the palbox if I were to join the guild back. I can't participate in boss fights or dungeons with them because if I join them, I would have to destroy the base I built. My base is nice neat and not cluttered and I want to stay on my base but I want to play with my friends too.. So I'm hoping they allow more then just 3 palboxes in the next update.. I really want to play with my friends and be happy doing so instead of just watching them grind bosses and having fun..;Recommended;684;106.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is most likely one of the best games I have played in at least 5 years.Customisation of the game is easy, mod friendly. I mean yea it's essentially a Pokemon rip off. But trust me. They've been around for a lot of years. The earliest one I have played was most likely jade cocoon.The pet battler genre i think we can agree has been around for years. And lets face it.It's not going anywhere.Just wish it had a bit more to do, but hell it's in alpha.Which is weird because it's oddly polished for such an early release.;Recommended;425;111.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I was a little skeptical with playing this game at first, when i first started i was kind of irritated because i never really played a survival game before but once i got used to it (still getting used to it lol) i'm obsessed. i absolutely love it so much. The pals are so cuteeeee!;Recommended;228;24.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is most likely one of the best games I have played in at least 5 years.Customisation of the game is easy, mod friendly. I mean yea it's essentially a Pokemon rip off. But trust me. They've been around for a lot of years. The earliest one I have played was most likely jade cocoon.The pet battler genre i think we can agree has been around for years. And lets face it.It's not going anywhere.Just wish it had a bit more to do, but hell it's in alpha.Which is weird because it's oddly polished for such an early release.;Recommended;425;111.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"The GistPokemon, Valheim and everything Ark. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect little game. But Professor Pocketpair accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction; passion!What I Liked✪ The devs are off to a great start with communication, transparency and making sure things keep going smoothly. It took a bit under 2 weeks for its first big patch, Xbox has addressed that it will be assisting with development[news.xbox.com] and the roadmap, though dateless, looks promising.✪ Home server tools were made available at launch with easy setup and plenty of customization options within its ini file. These options are also available in-game to those who would rather play solo or host a co-op lobby instead of their own server.✪ In most games that feature creature or character collection, just about everything we acquire lacks any kind of relevance beyond personal preference. We get them, then they go into storage while we keep our favorite few (or the meta, if you roll that way) in our party. In Palworld, every catch feels important because every Pal exists beyond simply being used for combat.✪ Pals are phenomenal creatures that I’ve already started to love more than the many species’ in competing worlds. With every Pal having their own set of animations, personalities, functions, sounds and reactions to the world around them, it’s hard not to wish for more from other games. I just hope they maintain this quality as more Pals are added to the roster.✪ Its map is massive and brimming with potential, featuring a lot of areas that scream “content update”. I’d love to see more towns, villages or even the addition of enemy headquarters eventually, but what we have now is alright thanks to how dense the Pal population is.✪ After you build a base, it’ll often be attacked by random groups of enemies. This turns what could have simply existed as a place to calm down, build up your stash and check on your Pals into a meaningful grind. How and where your bases are built matters, with the efficiency of your Pals being important to keep up with.✪ As someone who usually ends up building the bases, gathering resources and taking care of the wildlife that my friends bring back home, I’m incredibly appreciative of how automated the game’s resource management is. Pals can take care of every tedious task survival games offer, all while mostly taking care of themselves. This means that even though I personally love doing all the things I mentioned, I get to do more *with* my friends instead of focusing on doing stuff *for* them.✪ Boss fights are scattered around the map, offering a solid challenge as long as you’re within a few levels of them. They also function like the Pals you find in the wild, meaning they can be caught despite being bigger, more powerful and occasionally having different moves.✪ Many will go on about how much the game relies on shock humor and black comedy, but what we’re actually presented with is quite tame. Everything we see is just stuff that happens off-screen in the world of Pokemon, just goofier thanks to the lack of blood and comical use of ragdoll physics. I also don’t know about you, but all of my Pals are happy to work for me. These goobers have fluffy beds, their own hot tubs, cooked meals and are free to stop working whenever they want. Abuse? Enslavement? Not in this house, but you do you.✪ Its existence is a gift that keeps on giving, even beyond the game itself. From the immense amounts of success without press coverage before its release, to journalists and other game devs blatantly being bitter about the game blowing up. Even if this spark fades in a couple weeks, the entertainment it’s provided has been great across the board.✘ Whenever we craft, we have to hold down our interaction button until the item is finished. In the beginning, this doesn’t take much time since most things can be crafted within a couple seconds. As we near mid-game, we’re better off getting Pals to do everything for us because of how long things can take.✘ Similar to the last issue, bulk crafting items is tedious because of how quantity selection works. You can only go up by ones, tens, and the MAX button. You also can’t hold the selection button to make it go faster, so you’re clicking a lot just to reach the amount you want.✘ We’re limited to three bases when playing alone, which is incredibly limiting but at least kind of makes sense. However, when playing in a guild, you go from being allowed three bases by yourself to just three bases shared among everyone in the guild.• There isn’t any background music outside of combat. This isn’t terrible, but I think even a short song that plays while you explore would be great. Especially if they can give us different tunes for each biome.• Base building has a solid foundation, but it needs a lot of work. The overlapping issues, height adjustment limitations, lack of furniture functionality and more leave a lot to be desired.• I’ve yet to experience any serious bugs, but the ones I’ve been through are still pretty annoying. Just about all of them involve Pal behavior, from the Pals being stuck in place to getting lost under the map. There’s also an issue where gathering Liffmunk effigies to raise your capture rate actually decreases the rate.Palworld has quickly become one of my favorite Survival games, and if Pocketpair actually sticks with it, I can absolutely see myself coming back for hundreds of hours. I’m very much looking forward to every update and hope Palworld has a long life ahead of it.■ Playtime: 63 hours■ Visuals: A pleasing blend of vibrant, smooth and cartoony.■ Soundtrack: Solid, when we actually get music.■ Story: I’m not going to pretend I read any of the logs.■ DLC: None yet, but I’d gladly buy expansions.■ Photo Mode: Unfortunately, no.■ Optional Content: Everything is optional.■ Accessibility Options: None.■ Respects Your Time: Thanks to the ability to customize your playthrough, yes.■ Plan to 100%: Absolutely.";Recommended;4978;70.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Im writting this review with 2 hours of sleep and a week filled with fun.. i left my job, family, friends and gf to sit in a chair for hours capturing small cute creatures to make them slave away in my plantation only for them to starve to death bc game is fun. I highly recommend it.;Recommended;228;121.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Anyone who leaves a negative review is a pokemon fanboy that's mad that their favorite game series has been stagnant for 30 years. I've always loved pokemon, but lets be honest, they release the same game every time. It's good to finally see some innovation in the pocket monster genre. I'll keep it a buck 50. This game obviously takes features from a lot of other games, but everything is streamlined and simple to grasp. It's just downright fun, with an addictive gameplay loop. there's not really any friction to it. It's just fun. Something that a lot of game devs cant seem to do right, mostly because of greedy publishers that want to milk game time by adding a bunch of annoying bs.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game was explained to me as a meme Pokemon game, but with guns. Game freak wishes they had a game this good.I've dumped a ton of hours into this thing since it came out and it hits every button for me. Survival crafting, tech upgrades, visible progression and rewards for it, base building, open world exploration, collections. Its great. There are a ton of bugs sure, but compared to a bunch of AAA games that have released in the last year its way more cohesive as an early access game than most full releases. The Pals in camp feel more like a village, its less you are forcing them to work and it feels more like you are just a group of people helping out and surviving together. I cannot wait to see where they go from here.;Recommended;592;80.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Another early access game that is fun enough to justify the current price but just janky enough to make me feel kind of bad about buying it. It's pretty far from its full potential, and I'll never know the experience of playing it fresh on full release if it ever gets there.Pal storage maxes at 480, game requires you to have ~120 of one species at one time to max one pal. Lol.;Recommended;307;30.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The devs respond to the bug reports and have fixed many issues in regards to pals getting stuck in bases. sure i still encounter the odd bug here and there, but it has been extremely fun to play. if you love open world base building, exploration and just love to mess around with friends, its totally the game for you.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Another early access game that is fun enough to justify the current price but just janky enough to make me feel kind of bad about buying it. It's pretty far from its full potential, and I'll never know the experience of playing it fresh on full release if it ever gets there.Pal storage maxes at 480, game requires you to have ~120 of one species at one time to max one pal. Lol.;Recommended;307;30.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The devs respond to the bug reports and have fixed many issues in regards to pals getting stuck in bases. sure i still encounter the odd bug here and there, but it has been extremely fun to play. if you love open world base building, exploration and just love to mess around with friends, its totally the game for you. Bows, crossbows, guns, using pals to collect items for automation, the ideas are endless.;Recommended;335;94.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I've only scratched the surface. There is a lot to do, but almost no story. Very open world. You basically start by accessing your survival guide and follow the tutorial. Once you get strong enough and conquer the first tower, I think the tutorial ends and you're on your own. The little PDA you find on the beach says ""The towers are the key.."" To what, I have no idea.";Recommended;301;38.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game is really controversial. Bought it when it was on sale cause why not? My best way of describing this game is Ark with a Genshin Impact style of graphics.[Insert statement about how this is better than any recent pokemon game here];Recommended;194;17.7;

That's a lot of time to be thrown away for me. Maybe a fix will be made in the future but for now, i'm not chancing it again.";Not Recommended;320;45.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I do not even Like survival craft games.. at all. But, I seriously enjoy this game! The world is massive and full of bosses, dungeons and exploration. Pretty fun anyone fan of rpg/open world would most likely like this game giving you like pets/animals or say base building type content. Also there are random raids on your base which is cool. (npcs). flying mounts, ground mounts. Truely super cool game. and no this game is nothing like pokemon at all. It's just a creature catcher been around for ages. Never go full Fanboy, People.;Recommended;442;40.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A fun take on the monster catching genre with inspiration from many great games. Many of the Pal designs are surprisingly good for what appears to be Pokemon knock-off, though some designs are quite similar to existing Pokemon I personally do not mind that. It's much more than what it presents itself as and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much fun I've had on this game. I would highly recommend this game to any survival game enthusiasts or just about anyone who wants to have a fun time.;Recommended;410;23.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I've been a Pokemon fan since I was born. Popped out of the womb with a Pokeball and a Gengar plush. Growing up, I dissolved the first season of the anime repeatedly into my brain, since it was free to rent at our local Family Video. I started with Diamond, then moved up to Black and White, playing every Pokemon game in sequence as they came out. I was addicted.But, unfortunately, companies disappoint. The lovely pixel graphics, the endearing 2D battles eventually replaced by subpar 3D graphics and long, choppy battles. Legends Arceus was the most fun that I have had playing a Pokemon game since I first booted up Pokemon ORAS, and that is an incredibly depressing fact that took time to come to terms with. Between the overall mediocre experience provided by Legends Arceus, and the visually underwhelming and unpolished Scarlet and Violet, I had made a resolution; I couldn't play the next Pokemon game. I was done being disappointed and let down, and I couldn't keep buying products that I knew could be doing so much more. The open world concepts barely touched on in Scarlet and Violet, the barest hints of Crafting in Arceus, being able to ride and work alongside your Pokemon like every new iteration of limited rideable Pokemon, the idea of being encouraged to catch multiples of the same pokemon, even the concept of aiming Pokeballs were all so underused. I was done.Well, I might be done buying Pokemon games, but dear god, Palworld is everything I had ever wanted. A sturdy gameplay loop, crafting, working alongside your Pals, a REAL open world, riding any pals that make sense to ride, its all amazing. Sure, it has some downsides. The open world could be a bit more filled, the Pals could use a bit more originality in some areas, and its missing some key features (Like PVP), but they're actively working on many of these issues. All-in-all, Palworld is the epitome of how we all grew up imagining Pokemon to really feel like. The adventures I had in my head, the world that the anime portrayed. I love it. And, some Breath of the Wild and Ark Survival pieces to really pad out the game mechanics and exploration. Its not perfect, but God, I love Palworld.";Recommended;1797;42.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Game was super fun the whole time, finally got to level 25 having fun. Never had a crash until today (2/2/24). The one time it does crash for me i lose 37 hours of progress into the game. I've looked into the ""possible"" fix for replacing the old saves but none worked for me. That's a lot of time to be thrown away for me. Maybe a fix will be made in the future but for now, i'm not chancing it again.";Not Recommended;320;45.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I do not even Like survival craft games.. at all. But, I seriously enjoy this game! The world is massive and full of bosses, dungeons and exploration. Pretty fun anyone fan of rpg/open world would most likely like this game giving you like pets/animals or say base building type content. Also there are random raids on your base which is cool. (npcs). flying mounts, ground mounts. Truely super cool game. and no this game is nothing like pokemon at all. It's just a creature catcher been around for ages. Never go full Fanboy, People.;Recommended;442;40.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A fun take on the monster catching genre with inspiration from many great games. Many of the Pal designs are surprisingly good for what appears to be Pokemon knock-off, though some designs are quite similar to existing Pokemon I personally do not mind that. It's much more than what it presents itself as and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much fun I've had on this game. I would highly recommend this game to any survival game enthusiasts or just about anyone who wants to have a fun time.;Recommended;410;23.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I've been a Pokemon fan since I was born. Popped out of the womb with a Pokeball and a Gengar plush. Growing up, I dissolved the first season of the anime repeatedly into my brain, since it was free to rent at our local Family Video. I started with Diamond, then moved up to Black and White, playing every Pokemon game in sequence as they came out. I was addicted.But, unfortunately, companies disappoint. The lovely pixel graphics, the endearing 2D battles eventually replaced by subpar 3D graphics and long, choppy battles. Legends Arceus was the most fun that I have had playing a Pokemon game since I first booted up Pokemon ORAS, and that is an incredibly depressing fact that took time to come to terms with. Between the overall mediocre experience provided by Legends Arceus, and the visually underwhelming and unpolished Scarlet and Violet, I had made a resolution; I couldn't play the next Pokemon game. I was done being disappointed and let down, and I couldn't keep buying products that I knew could be doing so much more. The open world concepts barely touched on in Scarlet and Violet, the barest hints of Crafting in Arceus, being able to ride and work alongside your Pokemon like every new iteration of limited rideable Pokemon, the idea of being encouraged to catch multiples of the same pokemon, even the concept of aiming Pokeballs were all so underused. I was done.Well, I might be done buying Pokemon games, but dear god, Palworld is everything I had ever wanted. A sturdy gameplay loop, crafting, working alongside your Pals, a REAL open world, riding any pals that make sense to ride, its all amazing. Sure, it has some downsides. The open world could be a bit more filled, the Pals could use a bit more originality in some areas, and its missing some key features (Like PVP), but they're actively working on many of these issues. All-in-all, Palworld is the epitome of how we all grew up imagining Pokemon to really feel like. The adventures I had in my head, the world that the anime portrayed. I love it. And, some Breath of the Wild and Ark Survival pieces to really pad out the game mechanics and exploration. Its not perfect, but God, I love Palworld.";Recommended;1797;42.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Overall, Palworld is a very fun creature-catching game. However, the store page is a little misleading, and most of the gifs are not things that actually happen in the game, so I'm going to break this review up into the features on the store page.Survival:The survival aspects are pretty minimal. You and your pals need to eat, but it's not hard to get food. You can survive on just berries the whole game. The only other survival aspect is temperature. At the very beginning of the game, you'll need fire to keep warm at night, but once you get clothes, that's no longer a problem. Later on, you need special gear to travel into very hot or cold climates, or else you'll take damage over time. The gif about the Relaxaurus eating the Pengullet never happens in-game, although you do occasionally find enemies fighting each other, but mostly just humans fighting against wild Pals.Mounts & Exploration:There are many different ways of getting around, including running, swimming, climbing, gliding, riding, flying, and using a grappling hook, as well as fast-travel between any of your bases and certain eagle statues around the map. The world is also very well-designed, and rewards you for getting to hard-to-reach places. There will almost always be a treasure chest, egg, or lifmunk effigy on any summit you reach, as well as many other places. There are also different Pals in different regions, including some that are only found in caves or boss fights, meaning that you do need to travel a lot. All of this adds up to a really fun exploration experience while also giving you a reason to do so.Building Structures:The base-building is very rudimentary. You can place foundations, walls, doors, stairs, and roofs, but roofs and stairs will only snap from the top, not the bottom, so in order to build a roof that goes up from your walls instead of down, you need to first build some even taller walls, build the roof from them, and then take the walls down. To build double story stairs, you need to do similar shenanigans. There are no triangular wall pieces to fill in under a roof. You can't build foundations on more than one level and have them snap together. So if you build near a short cliff, you can build a foundation at the top, stairs down, but then you can't snap anything to the bottom of the stairs to continue the structure at a lower level. There is lots of decorative furniture you can place around the base, but it seems like a waste of tech points. Also, Pals have a really hard time navigating structures, and will sometimes just find it impossible to do a task if it's inside, so it's actually better to just build everything outside and skip structures altogether.Production:You can assign Pals jobs at your base, such as chopping trees, collecting stone, farming, or crafting things. Although this is useful, it's not very reliable. There's no way to give Pals work priorities, so that they focus on one task, then switch to another if the first one is done or unavailable. You can pick Pals up and toss them at a job to make them focus on it, but even that doesn't work very well, since they'll often claim there's no job available when you toss them right onto the job that needs to be done. It's also very common for pals to get stuck and do nothing while they slowly starve, so you have to go back and check on them often. It would be really great if there were a management interface and Pals could reliably move around and take care of themselves, but as it is now, you just set them up with what they need and hope they do something.Farming:Yes, there is farming, and it does seem more reliable than most production.Factories & Automation:There really isn't any. You can have pals mine stone and chop wood; you can have them turn stone into Palium; you can have them use stone, wood, and Palium to craft Pal Spheres; but you cannot tell them to do these steps over and over on their own forever or until you reach 100 Pal Spheres. They will grow berries forever, and you can come back to base every once in a while and tell them to cook all the berries, then come back later to put the cooked berries in the food basket, but you can't make them automatically cook berries when they're available or put them in the basket when they're cooked. The conveyor belts you see on the store page are just upgraded workbenches that work in the exact same way as regularworkbenches.Dungeon Exploration:Dungeon exploration is fun. There are caves, sealed realms, and towers scattered across the map, containing resources, bosses, rewards, and challenging goals to work towards.Breeding & Genetics:You can breed your pals to try to get offspring that have the combined traits of their parents. Give them boosts to attack, defense, and health for fighting; better work speed and less food consumption for working; or more movement speed for riding.Poaching & Crime:Yes, you can commit crimes, but it's really not a very big aspect of the game unless you want it to be. You can beat up humans, which will get you in trouble with the police, who will spawn forever and get tougher and tougher until you die. There are wildlife sanctuaries where I guess you could get caught by the police if you're completely oblivious or looking for trouble, but I have never once been caught.Multiplayer:There's cooperative multiplayer but no PVP. Each player gets their own pals and progression, whether they're in a guild together or not. You can trade Pals with your guild members by assigning them to the base and someone else taking them. You can't actually prevent them from doing that. You can also lock doors and containers so that even your guildmates can't open them unless they guess your PIN.Now for some features that were not includedPal Capturing, upgrading, and customization:It seems very strange that this is not the top feature on the store page, but this is a game based around capturing wildlife and making them your pets. You can then assign them to follow you around and help you in combat or stay at your base and work for you. Captured Pals have semi-randomized stats and some passive abilities, so you can catch a bunch of the same Pal and get different stats on them. Once you have caught a Pal you like, you can name it, give it new skills by feeding it skill fruits, upgrade it with pal souls that you find scattered about the map, or melt your other pals of the same type to feed it their essence. Every Pal also has a special ability, some of which you can activate automatically, and others that require you to craft a special piece of equipment to use.Combat:Combat is very engaging. Unlike most survival games, you are not reduced to primarily kiting. Most enemies have multiple attacks, and there are all sorts of attacks with different areas of effect, speeds, and other characteristics such as passing through obstacles or following their target. You can fight on foot alongside one of your Pals or mount a Pal and use its abilities.Tech Tree:As you gain levels, beat bosses, and explore the world, you unlock technology points that you can use to unlock items from the tech tree, but the balance is totally wonky. There are lots of things from the tech tree that are just as good as, or worse than, a previously-available version but still require more resources to make.Character Customization:There are some limited character customization options. You can change the thickness of your arms, legs, and torso, pick from a set of faces and hairs, and choose any color for your hair, skin, eyes, and facial hair. There are also a selection of eyes which are pretty cool.Artwork:You can see the art style yourself in the videos and images. Most of the Pals are cute. I read a post on reddit where someone asked who everyone's favorite pals were, and I was shocked by how many different answers there were. To me, that indicates some very good character design. Some items seem to use placeholder art.";Recommended;6553;90.6;

You can place foundations, walls, doors, stairs, and roofs, but roofs and stairs will only snap from the top, not the bottom, so in order to build a roof that goes up from your walls instead of down, you need to first build some even taller walls, build the roof from them, and then take the walls down. To build double story stairs, you need to do similar shenanigans. There are no triangular wall pieces to fill in under a roof. You can't build foundations on more than one level and have them snap together. So if you build near a short cliff, you can build a foundation at the top, stairs down, but then you can't snap anything to the bottom of the stairs to continue the structure at a lower level. There is lots of decorative furniture you can place around the base, but it seems like a waste of tech points. Also, Pals have a really hard time navigating structures, and will sometimes just find it impossible to do a task if it's inside, so it's actually better to just build everything outside and skip structures altogether.Production:You can assign Pals jobs at your base, such as chopping trees, collecting stone, farming, or crafting things. Although this is useful, it's not very reliable. There's no way to give Pals work priorities, so that they focus on one task, then switch to another if the first one is done or unavailable. You can pick Pals up and toss them at a job to make them focus on it, but even that doesn't work very well, since they'll often claim there's no job available when you toss them right onto the job that needs to be done. It's also very common for pals to get stuck and do nothing while they slowly starve, so you have to go back and check on them often. It would be really great if there were a management interface and Pals could reliably move around and take care of themselves, but as it is now, you just set them up with what they need and hope they do something.Farming:Yes, there is farming, and it does seem more reliable than most production.Factories & Automation:There really isn't any. You can have pals mine stone and chop wood; you can have them turn stone into Palium; you can have them use stone, wood, and Palium to craft Pal Spheres; but you cannot tell them to do these steps over and over on their own forever or until you reach 100 Pal Spheres. They will grow berries forever, and you can come back to base every once in a while and tell them to cook all the berries, then come back later to put the cooked berries in the food basket, but you can't make them automatically cook berries when they're available or put them in the basket when they're cooked. The conveyor belts you see on the store page are just upgraded workbenches that work in the exact same way as regularworkbenches.Dungeon Exploration:Dungeon exploration is fun. There are caves, sealed realms, and towers scattered across the map, containing resources, bosses, rewards, and challenging goals to work towards.Breeding & Genetics:You can breed your pals to try to get offspring that have the combined traits of their parents. Give them boosts to attack, defense, and health for fighting; better work speed and less food consumption for working; or more movement speed for riding.Poaching & Crime:Yes, you can commit crimes, but it's really not a very big aspect of the game unless you want it to be. You can beat up humans, which will get you in trouble with the police, who will spawn forever and get tougher and tougher until you die. There are wildlife sanctuaries where I guess you could get caught by the police if you're completely oblivious or looking for trouble, but I have never once been caught.Multiplayer:There's cooperative multiplayer but no PVP. Each player gets their own pals and progression, whether they're in a guild together or not. You can trade Pals with your guild members by assigning them to the base and someone else taking them. You can't actually prevent them from doing that. You can also lock doors and containers so that even your guildmates can't open them unless they guess your PIN.Now for some features that were not includedPal Capturing, upgrading, and customization:It seems very strange that this is not the top feature on the store page, but this is a game based around capturing wildlife and making them your pets. You can then assign them to follow you around and help you in combat or stay at your base and work for you. Captured Pals have semi-randomized stats and some passive abilities, so you can catch a bunch of the same Pal and get different stats on them. Once you have caught a Pal you like, you can name it, give it new skills by feeding it skill fruits, upgrade it with pal souls that you find scattered about the map, or melt your other pals of the same type to feed it their essence. Every Pal also has a special ability, some of which you can activate automatically, and others that require you to craft a special piece of equipment to use.Combat:Combat is very engaging. Unlike most survival games, you are not reduced to primarily kiting. Most enemies have multiple attacks, and there are all sorts of attacks with different areas of effect, speeds, and other characteristics such as passing through obstacles or following their target. You can fight on foot alongside one of your Pals or mount a Pal and use its abilities.Tech Tree:As you gain levels, beat bosses, and explore the world, you unlock technology points that you can use to unlock items from the tech tree, but the balance is totally wonky. There are lots of things from the tech tree that are just as good as, or worse than, a previously-available version but still require more resources to make.Character Customization:There are some limited character customization options. You can change the thickness of your arms, legs, and torso, pick from a set of faces and hairs, and choose any color for your hair, skin, eyes, and facial hair. There are also a selection of eyes which are pretty cool.Artwork:You can see the art style yourself in the videos and images. Most of the Pals are cute. I read a post on reddit where someone asked who everyone's favorite pals were, and I was shocked by how many different answers there were. To me, that indicates some very good character design. Some items seem to use placeholder art.";Recommended;6553;90.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;POST THE REVIEW;Recommended;13;10.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Very obviously early access. Has some of the worst aspects of games like Ark in excess - your game loop will pretty much consist of grinding Pals (either capture or kill) for special resources, and using fast travel to reset nodes for a scant few resources that aren't capable of being produced through idle buildings. This game loop is there in order to unlock new features for your base simply for treadmilling through the game's buildings/features. There's very little to *do* once you step away from the treadmill of getting through the game's buildings.There are a number of pretty game ruining bugs - just as a few examples - Pal pathing AI is *really* bad, and you can end up with your monsters stuck unable to do anything on completely flat ground for no real reason until they start dying from starvation. You can also capture and use the game's bosses - which have tens of thousands of HP.And that's okay, the game's like a week old. NOW, if this is the case next year? Then I'll be sounding the alarm.Once these things get fixed, and more gets added to the game beyond just expanding your base, THEN we'll be see. For now, I can't really call this game 'playable' - it's basically just a really detailed demo, to be honest.;Not Recommended;1014;25.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Very fun to play with friends or alone. Ofcourse there are bugs because game is new but usually they are harmless. Only one bad bug happened to me. When i unmounted pal in water near earth wall to climb up to land, my character felled to bottom of ocean. My stuff stayed in bottom. I managed to get them. I took galeclaw, flying pal and swimming pal and redid bug. When i falled to bottom again, i used galeclaw to glide and land to bottom. I picked my stuff and then started to fly with my pal. I didnt have enpugh stamina to fly all the way up, but somehow after few tries my character warped to base and when i reloaded to server, i was ok and could continue to play. When it is ready and bugs fixed, it have tons of fun.;Recommended;581;41.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Overall a fun game, with lots to see, loot, shoot, build and collect. I found it a refreshing take on the genera.Played Normal with standard settings and it got grindy in the midgame, Beat every fight in the game.Didnt get into breeding at all, it just seamed like a massive timesink, something that you have to do to beat the higher difficulties or to minmax your Palteam for the upcoming raids.Early game is GREAT- You get rewarded for exploring.- You get cool ♥♥♥♥ from dungeons.- The Pals you catch have impact as you progress throughout the game.- Progression through levels and the techtree feels nice in a way, even tho techpoints is slightly boring. (too me)Then mid to late game comes around and ore becomes a bottleneck for your progress.- weapons, armor, ammo and base upgrades needs this. Perhaps it was my fault for not setting up 2x Orebases from the beginning. Once i had 2x Orebases i had what i needed in terms of materials.Lategame is actually not doable until you hit level 50.- 50lvl Bosses take 1 dmg from everything, before you and your Pals hit 47-50- Farmed the Legendary Assult Rifle and even then I did like 11dmg vs legendary Pals, all while the tower bosses got destroyed.Pros:- Early game is great, if youre playing to for the first time its a great adventure.- First 25 lvls are great. (kinda the same as the first point, I know)- The Pals are unique and fun, ""funnylooking"" or badass in some cases.- Getting the first gun and shooting a Cativa in the face was almost alone worth the buy.Cons:- Late game xp grind was horrible, I cant even imagine farming 40-50 on my pals again in my lifespan. (maybe if I ramp the xp to max on my own server)- Dmg to lategame fights specificly the legendary fights was horrible. doing like 11 dmg to something with the best weapon in the game feelt lackluster and boring. (this was on the normal setting for player dmg, on higher difficulties the dmg would have been lower (I know its a monster catching game the monsters are suppose to do the dmg but sometimes they dont))- Your Pals AI feels unfinnished or maybe you just have to control em through rideing for them to be effective.- Online Servers Lags like hell, doing hard bosses on these servers are not advisable. (constant rubberbanding in bossbattles)It just feels like the most of the game is abit frontloaded which is to be expected from a Early Access game.The Developers have alot of work to do and alot of stuff they need to fix.Its an Early Access game, you will fall through the map, bugs will appear and stuff will happen.Didnt seam right to include this in the ""Cons:"" section, because its in Early Access so its expected.With all that's been said I still recommend the game.For a fan of ""other"" monster catching game this journey has been equally Fun and addicting.TDLR: Fun game, not finnished but FUN.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Great game, if you played ARK or Conan Exiles, it is somewhat similar, base building and tech-tree is like ARK, almost 1 to 1, even how you level up your character, selecting a single perk to add a bonus, and just like ARK, Weight, Stamina and HP are the best options.It has the collection dynamic gameplay that is very addicting, it reminds me of that feeling from playing Pokemon when I was younger, the more you play, the more you discover, and I recommend you not watch many guides online, because the ""Meta"" always ruins your experience, just take the game slow, the first hour can be a bit tedious, but if you push through it becomes very fun and addicting, it hooks you right away, and you feel that you need to uncover more secrets, more technology, new Pals, new weapons, new team combinations, new, new, new...There are very few cons, all can be fixable though:1- AI and path-finding, this needs a ton of work, devs will have their plates full with this one.2- Base efficiency, so, the first base you create is always useless later on because you realize how big some of the stuff you need to build is, so a good flat terrain is always necessary for a ""main"" base, you can build multiple floors but back to issues with AI and path-finding.3- You need to be able to lock certain Buildings for certain Pals, or limit Pals into a certain jobs, instead of focusing on just 1, like, lets say I want this Pal that is capable of doing 5 jobs, but I want him to do only 4, of those 5, I can`t.4- Need a ""scheduler"" similar to Rim-World, where you can assign Pals to do certain jobs at certain hours of the day, or eat food at certain moments until X% is reached, because currently if you have a larger Pal at your base that eats a lot of food, when he goes hungry it only eat a couple of berries, just enough to pass the ""hungry"" threshold, would be nice to have a ""lunch hour"" where all Pals eat to 100%, instead of doing a job for 10 seconds and back to eat a couple of berries, in loop.5- Would also be great to make so our Pals can have free access to a ""closed gate"" if they are assigned to base defense, what happens is if the gate is closed while the base is under attack, the Pal just stays there, instead of defending the gate and prevent it`s destruction, even Flying pals suffer this issue, I would understand for grounded Pals, but not flying ones.6- Need more NPC variety on the over-world, it has plenty but they all look and feel the same, would be great to see some other ""hunters"" like ourselves catching Pals so we can battle, betting some money, upgrade points, pal spheres, pals, cosmetics, and etc... Also tournament would be nice.7- Need factions and a reputation system for said factions to gain access to new technology and cosmetics.8- Need a way to transport resources from different bases, flying Pals should be able to be assigned for this hole, and this can generate a new gameplay as well, other factions having their ""loot"" being transported and can be taken by the player, like hijacking a cargo hauler.9- Need to allow ""forward bases"" instead of a whole new base, something smaller and simpler just for resource gathering, maybe Pals can teleport there, gather materials, put in a box and teleport back later on, just an idea of-course.10- Need better off-screen work efficiency for Pals, if I`m in a Ore gathering base that I made, it generates about 100 ores within 15 minutes, if I`m not there, after 15 minutes it only generated 12, it seems the processing power is reduced for obvious performance reasons when you are not near your base, also notice the Pals are ""frozen"" for a few seconds after teleporting, maybe that wouldn`t be the case in an online server, but for offline this is a bummer.";Recommended;3054;44.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;no story line and its still deeper than any recent Pokemon game.;Recommended;53;63.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I really REALLY love Palworld but I probably wouldn't recommend it for the time being due to one reason and that is that it's TOO grindy to level up. The best way to level up is catching 10 of the same species of Pals. I'm at a bit of a standstill in my playthrough as I'm level 30 but need to be, according to sources, level 40 to tackle the next boss and I just don't have it in me to repeatedly keep catching the same Pal over and over again. It's too boring.. and not to mention it takes ages to craft spheres unless you have the conveyor belt. I really want to keep playing but I wish there were other ways to gain XP and or level up quicker. There also isn't a story which makes the game feel quite bare at times.;Not Recommended;575;43.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Good Game, I Personally Recommend.;Recommended;30;49.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Coming into the game I did not hear an accurate description of gameplay. Just you are able to shoot your favorite [REDACTED] from a game we all know and love since we were children. After actually watching gameplay I knew that this would be a game for me.You have your survival element, base building, and basic fighting. Despite its early access status there is a back story that you can collect across the already huge map. I remember I recently found a huge dragon egg and I was back to being a child again obsessed with magic and dragons. Of course I was immediately killed by the neighboring dragon but it was so much fun despite having to backtrack and find my stuff on Mount Obsidian.You can spend hours playing this game without realizing it. The developer obviously took what gamers have been saying for years that they wanted and put it all into one game. Plus, it is cheaper then the yearly game from that other developer with loads more content. *cough* Have fun!;Recommended;801;37.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"never really been a fan of pokemon style games of catching animals and using them to fight, but a huge fan of survival games... this game got me hooked from the get go.Building pieces on the game are lacking a fair amount so for me as a survival player who likes to build it really messes with the lack of creativity but i guess thats not the main focus atm and i dont mind that as the rest of the game is great.auto crafting from your box's in base is a huge win. so many survival games do not do this and modders come to the rescue this game took notice of that and delivers.Using your pals to auto farm basic resources in your base is also very nice and gives you time to focus on more combat in the game and this is where it comes into play as your main source of XP is capturing 10 of each pal you come across ontop of just dungeon crawling/boss crawling for resources, this game keeps you more active in combat outside rather than hitting trees and rocks for an hour or two a day. most of the good resources you need towards end game (im only level 36) atm is from boss mobs, or pals around the world so once again you are more out fighting than in your base or hitting trees.Upgrading pals is a simple mechanic many games do, 5 stars and you increase it by combinding the same pal increasing in number the higher the star you go. so you will find yourself needing to capture many and many of the same pal to do this, i recomend catching them all before doing your first upgrade that way you can target the perfect passive skill you want for it.all around so far great game, for me im not a fan of waiting 5 years for things to craft so i loved the game for the ease of catching pals but the breeding for me is abit naff atm, takes way to long and there is no clear way to fully understand how to get each egg 100% comfortable, i have tried taking my eggs that need to be hot to the volcanic area and still not good enough along with crafting camp fires and more... either patch this so it works easier with information on items ""fire pit, can also increase heat on incubation"" would be so simple for us. or just scrap it and lower timers";Recommended;1725;59.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's Pokemon meets Fallout 76. Survival with your new best friends! Some of them really do look like Pokemon but there are enough differences that I'm not super worried about it. I love base building and when I get bored/need resources there is plenty for me to do to get them. It's pretty awesome and a lot of fun! At HALF the price I would pay for a big name game you really get your money's worth out of this. I'll be playing it for years, I'm sure.;Recommended;365;117.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a voice begins reading its text:SHREK: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love's first kiss.The voice laughs. A big, green hand rips out a page of the book and shuts it closed.SHREK: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of -We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps SHREK, an ogre, who tugs at his underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the swamp he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. This includes taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign.In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them.NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEVILLAGER 1: Think it's in there?VILLAGER 2: All right. Let's get it!VILLAGER 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?VILLAGER 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob.SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.The mob gasp.SHREK: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear.VILLAGERS: No!SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.VILLAGER 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it.VILLAGER 1: Right...Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming.SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.ALL: (Screaming!!!)Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can.SHREK: And stay out!He looks down and picks up a wanted poster dropped by one of the villagers. He reads it aloud.SHREK: ""Wanted. Fairytale creatures""?He sighs and walks off. dropping the poster to the ground.THE NEXT DAY - FORESTFairy tale creatures are put in chains and led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying a line of people their rewards for turning in the fairytale creatures. Those waiting in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.GUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!THE CAPTAIN: Next!GUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)THE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!The captain hands over the reward to the villager who turned the witch in. The villager mutters to himself.VILLAGER: Lousy twenty pieces...GUARD: Get up! Come on!Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. He looks in horror at the witch and a group of dwarves being loaded into a wagon.GUARD: Sit down there! Be quiet!Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.DONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!OLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (Smacks Donkey)DONKEY: Oh!THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?GEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)THE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.PINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?OLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.THE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.OLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).THE CAPTAIN: Well?..OLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey again) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!THE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!OLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talking-est damn thing you ever saw.THE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.OLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.DONKEY: Hey! I can fly!PETER PAN: He can fly!THREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!THE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)THE CAPTAIN: Seize him!Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.GUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!Donkey escapes deeper into the forest and runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides behind him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.THE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!SHREK: Aye?THE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.SHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something";Recommended;6494;59.9;

For her true love and true love's first kiss.The voice laughs. A big, green hand rips out a page of the book and shuts it closed.SHREK: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of -We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps SHREK, an ogre, who tugs at his underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the swamp he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. This includes taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign.In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them.NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEVILLAGER 1: Think it's in there?VILLAGER 2: All right. Let's get it!VILLAGER 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?VILLAGER 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob.SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.The mob gasp.SHREK: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear.VILLAGERS: No!SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.VILLAGER 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it.VILLAGER 1: Right...Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming.SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.ALL: (Screaming!!!)Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can.SHREK: And stay out!He looks down and picks up a wanted poster dropped by one of the villagers. He reads it aloud.SHREK: ""Wanted. Fairytale creatures""?He sighs and walks off. dropping the poster to the ground.THE NEXT DAY - FORESTFairy tale creatures are put in chains and led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying a line of people their rewards for turning in the fairytale creatures. Those waiting in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.GUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!THE CAPTAIN: Next!GUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)THE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!The captain hands over the reward to the villager who turned the witch in. The villager mutters to himself.VILLAGER: Lousy twenty pieces...GUARD: Get up! Come on!Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. He looks in horror at the witch and a group of dwarves being loaded into a wagon.GUARD: Sit down there! Be quiet!Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.DONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!OLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (Smacks Donkey)DONKEY: Oh!THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?GEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)THE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.PINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?OLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.THE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.OLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).THE CAPTAIN: Well?..OLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey again) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!THE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!OLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talking-est damn thing you ever saw.THE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.OLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.DONKEY: Hey! I can fly!PETER PAN: He can fly!THREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!THE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)THE CAPTAIN: Seize him!Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.GUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!Donkey escapes deeper into the forest and runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides behind him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.THE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!SHREK: Aye?THE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.SHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something";Recommended;6494;59.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game is fuggin' sweeeeet. I think my favorite part about it is that it's not Pokémon, which means it can be fun and they can do whatever they want.Of course there's a water type duck-Pal named F au ck. Of course Paldeck No. 69 is a freak. You wanna capture that human? Okay, but you're wanted by authorities. Hell, catch them, too- you can just do that.One of the main selling points for me was that it has guns! But, you don't get your first tech for a makeshift pistol until level 24! Sure you can make a bow or a cross bow, but forget that, I'm tryna SHOOT that muffugga. Of course, you don't HAVE to wait to get a gun though. You could very well find a schematic for a high quality weapon early, if you explore and have the materials; not to mention, you can craft one time key items for your Pals and give them guns, too. So that's pretty rad.Now, there's ways of gaining experience through crafting and battling but, my favorite is capturing Pals. Since you can only gain exp from catching 10 of each, you're never stuck grinding one place forever - which is great for encouraging exploration. Which means you can find a place to settle down your bases (almost) anywhere!There's so much to do with Pals from powering my single light bulb to caring for unconscious Pals that give themselves ulcers from their workaholic trait! Personally I take care of my Pals and they're happy to live with me. Yes, even the Syndicate, PDIFs, Merchants and civilians I caught as soon as I could get my first sphere. They're all happy to live with me, I promise.As for enslaving Pals/humans? glad you can do it. It even tells you that it's frowned upon! So, why not?This isn't baby pokémon.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;A masterpiece in progress.RNG system is somewhat busted. Fun, but could be better IMHO.Percentage chances should align with rolls of the displayed percent. A 60% capture chance shouldn't fail 60 times in a row. Here's a basic rundown.To calculate the percentage chance of a successful roll based on a given chance rate and a number of rolls, you can use the formula:Success_Rate = 1 - (1 - p) ^ nWhere:- Success_Rate is the percentage chance of a successful roll.- p is the chance rate in decimal form (e.g., 0.6 for 60% chance).- n is the number of rolls.To use this formula:1. Replace p with the chance rate (as a decimal).2. Replace n with the number of rolls.3. Calculate (1 - p) ^ n.4. Subtract the result from 1 to get the success rate.For example, if you have n rolls at a 60% chance for success (p = 0.6), you would calculate the success rate as follows:Success_Rate = 1 - (1 - 0.6) ^ nAs you increase the number of rolls (n), the success rate will approach 100%, assuming the chance rate (p) remains constant.;Recommended;835;94.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Ark meets Pokemon with Zelda elements, whats not to love?That being said I find myself mostly shooting the wild Pals instead of using my Pals, mostly using a Pal to get the wild ones HP to half way and then just shooting it until 25% HP is left. Wish there was more Pal trainers in the wild instead of just in the towers. But for an early accuses game it has huge promise and Ill stay with it till the end!;Recommended;326;51.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Love the game! Once the bugs and stuff are fixed it'll be perfect. I do hope they add a difference in physical appearance between males and female pals. Like maybe colors or actual physical changes but thats just my imagination. They could also do that for the shiny pals besides just making them huge. Over all the game 10/10, graphics 10/10, story line 3/10 (I didn't exactly know anything besides like kill the tower bosses and in the beginning when they said the towers were the key.) Pal creatures 10/10 can't wait to see what else they add and come up with. (Tbh Pal world if yall make a creature like the Thanator from avatar. I'd literally love yall forever. or maybe even like a bio-luminescence creatures and land that would be so sick.) anyways keep up the good work <3 love the game and excited to see what they add!;Recommended;678;121.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is absolutely amazing and filled with so much to do, and there will be so much more to do as they continue to update it and add more features, even though the game is a bit buggy there isnt a single thing here that would make me dislike it;Recommended;199;9.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Preface: This game is not up my alley. I found it to be boring and non-engaging, and mostly a slog to progress through.Outside of my bias, this game is pretty good for early access.Large world with many handcrafted elements and plenty of room for future expansion. There are a few visually distinct and attractive areas, as well as many areas that are flat or plentiful with resources to build your bases.Pal design is visually distinct from other franchises that are of the same archetype of design/genre.Enslavement of pals and forcing them into your sweatshop is quite a hilarious concept.And thats i really have to say that is good.Now the not so great.A main selling point of this game (largely to the american audience) is the guns. They feel tacked on last minute, and up until late/end game you will be using a crossbow for 90% of the time. Crafting weapons is locked until level 30(ish) and while the cost to make the weapons is not high, the real cost is the ammo crafting time. It takes an absurdly long time to craft most end game items, even with high level pals doing the automation.Which leads me to the next pain point. The ""automation."" With the lack of a ui to assign pals to certain tasks, the ""automation"" becomes a task of finding pals, picking them up and throwing them at the station you want to assign them to, only for them to walk away 2 mins later and do something else you dont want them to do. And combined with absurdly long craft times, this adds an artificial amount of time to the already long craft times.The ""boss fights"" are lame.Lack of healing items.All in all, the game is not even half baked. Its like quarter baked.Good real potential here, but I wont be suprised if the game dies off by the end of the year if they dont start doing some real major additions within the next 3-6 months.";Recommended;1498;31.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Extremely addictive. I wish there was an option to make a world with friends without creating a server and having to have the owner always online, but honestly that's my only real gripe.

Devs are active so you know report bugs so my helzephrs can stop getting stuck on a random wall.Also 10/10 the mozzarina enjoys making milk too much.;Recommended;294;180.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Definitely recommend and no it has nothing to do with Pokemon or Fortnite. For an early access game they added a lot of game and they're updating almost every day. I have a hunch there's stuff they're updating through hotfixes as well so don't believe the crap you read on the internet. This is a remix of all the best things of games you could ever imagine. It's fun as hell, find a buddy and go wild.;Recommended;326;104.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fantastic how I've spent nearly 2 weeks trying to work towards getting the Jormuntide Ignis, got him, couldn't assign him to cook anything because of the bugs. So i quit playing, update comes out claiming to fix it and guess what? For every other Pal, yes. Jormuntide is too big, he quite literally breaks the patch that has just been released, maybe don't put Pals THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LARGE and just have every player struggling to do anything with it because its clearly not made to be that size.;Not Recommended;404;74.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Throughout my time playing games I've become quite tired of the triple A game developer tricks of the trade.Quest markers railroading the player experience, drawn out tutorials, lack of player agency, etc.Games nowadays have become generic slop en mass, but this game has been a nice change of pace.There's a tutorial, but I can choose to take it my own pace, when and where are questions I have to answer, not the game.Progression is my decision, and the game lets me decide what I want to do first and foremost in it's progression system and in it's utilization of pals.The game can be quite difficult depending on your settings if you want a nice challenge, or if you just wanna relax, automate, and hangout with a bunch of fictional creatures, you can adjust your settings accordingly, but on the topic of automation, the optimization of your automation really gives me a great deal of satisfaction, and the fact it doesn't disrupt the flow or balance of the game is a testament to pocket pair's ability to seamlessly blend elements of other genre's into their games.The combat system is one of my only points of contention, though it's more of a matter of personal opinion than a legitimate criticism, I just don't like having to rely on my pals to get stuff done in a battle, and to the game's merit the weapons you get aren't bad or inefficient, but there most certainly is more incentive to whip out the pals.On the subject of pals, I adore how they are used in this game, complete and utter freedom to use them as you see fit, even if that usage is unethical. The game doesn't try to lecture you on proper morals, it just let's you run crazy and let's you face the natural consequences of your actions.It's very much appreciated in an era of games that want to shovel whatever hack writer's definition of justice is down your throat.My only real critique with this game is progression being a little slow, the rate at which you level up, collect resources, and move through the tech tree is... kinda a grind, it's not far off from where it needs to be if you ask me, just think mining and tree chopping should be faster to allow you to grind out pal captures for exp, or possibly increasing exp payout from chopping and mining, either way it's still nothing to scoff at.To conclude, for a small team and in three years, this game is quite a marvel.I've been following the developers since last year and it has truly been exciting for me to watch their work explode in the fashion it has.This game deserves the attention and hype surrounding it, and it's nice to see.As for the legality of the game and the like? Not my problem.8/10.Thank you pocket pair.;Recommended;2187;11.1;

Guns. Progression. Unique abilities. Slavery.What's there not to love?100% worth full price.;Recommended;357;41.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Very good game, worth the money. a lot of replay-ability. Idk maybe 3.5 to 4.5 stars outta 5 depending on what your looking for.Some stuff i see that needs fixed isYou cant build to close to objects or other bases. Pals like to walk where your building and block you from building also. Its to hard to Glitch to catch the Trainers riding Pals. This should be allowed as long as its your 2nd time or more fighting them. I don't like the ""Shiny"" sound its annoying but helpful. I realise im not playing minecraft but i cant stress building changes hard enough. People hated the building mechanics in fallout 4 and this is a lot like that. We also need more world options when setting up our game, I am having to use external stuff to change it which is risky in itself, hopefully since im only on my own world or my friends who also uses it it will be fine. Its basically mods but im seeing those up already on the nexus also. Hopefully they add matchmaking or opening your world to public or something.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Yeah....... I gotta say, it's great. Fantastic, even.I was slightly interested when I first started but it has really grown on me. I really hope this game gets the polish and attention to detail it very much needs, but even without the polish, it's still a blast.Cute Creatures. Automation. Exploration. Base building. Movement. Guns. Progression. Unique abilities. Slavery.What's there not to love?100% worth full price.;Recommended;357;41.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Very good game, worth the money. a lot of replay-ability. Idk maybe 3.5 to 4.5 stars outta 5 depending on what your looking for.Some stuff i see that needs fixed isYou cant build to close to objects or other bases. Pals like to walk where your building and block you from building also. Its to hard to Glitch to catch the Trainers riding Pals. This should be allowed as long as its your 2nd time or more fighting them. I don't like the ""Shiny"" sound its annoying but helpful.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The fact that Palworld launched as Early Access Game for me is really surprising. Many other AAA games get launched broken, and they in span of few months either patch everything or abandon the game altogether. Palworld being title with small unknown team behind it was really refreshing. No goals apart from wanting to get stronger and trying to expand my base and survive feel good. After first week I've spend 26 hours with this game. At this pace either I'll soon burn out (probably when I'll get the best flying pal) or I'll get bored playing.;Recommended;452;29.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Haters will hate, but minus some small bugs & areas [still in early access stage] , this game is great. Now... IF ONLY A CERTAIN COMPANY(S) WHOM HAS HELD THE MONOPOLY ON THIS GENRE STOPPED BEING LAZY, their games would be fine [] I own 3 of those [incomplete] games, and have been an avid buyer [from Gen. 01 - Present] since the inception...

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I really like this game. I think it's a great fun take on survival games and it hits all the right notes of Pokemon nostalgia.Unfortunately, Pals simply do NOT do any work unless I am standing in the base to supervise them. I don't know if it's an AI issue, memory usage or what, but it makes it impossible to actually progress your production late game unless you just putter around your bases instead of going out and exploring/catching pals.I'm going to be setting this aside until the devs figure out a fix for this. I'll happily change my review at that time.;Not Recommended;462;56.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Product refundedI don't get the hype. All the ideas in this game are ripped from other games and they make no attempts to hide it. That's all fine and good, but if you're going to just mimic other peoples work you should at least try to do it better. Palworld does not. It's like Palworld is like a Chinese KFG. The game is incredibly janky and glitchy. I froze twice in my first 30 minutes. The lag in multiplayer was comical but even the enjoyment I received from that faded. I understand it's early access, so perhaps it will improve. As it stands right now however, the hype is completely overblown and I'm certain will fade in time.;Not Recommended;520;0.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;As someone who has Pokemon near and dear to my heart, Palworld is an absolute thrill to play...and just a little bit addicting. However, once I got to a certain point in the game, there really isn't much to do once you beat all the bosses. But, this game is VERY early access so there's gonna be a lot more coming (giggity) in the future.if you are a Pokemon fan, please give Palworld a chance.;Recommended;320;41.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I used to be married to Ark, even though he'd rough me up and kill my tames with blue-screen errors. But I had it coming and it was my fault for not having dinner on the table when Ark got home from work.But that all changed when I finally got the courage to leave Ark and start dating Palworld! I never knew I could be treated so well by a survival/taming/crafting game!Palworld has multiple excellent gameplay loops. You can cycle between combat, peaceful mining, exploration, breeding, building and more.The sense of progression is satisfying, the art is lovely, and the game developers provided a more polished experience in the first week of early access than Ark did over 5 years.;Recommended;567;73.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It is a fun little game, No, I don't consider it a knock off. Combat is fun, 138 logged hours. Only issues really, are/were the server stability problems. Objects, and Pals - and once in a while you as well falling through the world, or spawning in - inside a mountain. Only has happened a handful of times in the 138 hours ive played. All in all A+sidenote: forgot about the breeding. I find that to be.. Irksome. Unsure why it has to be cake.. why the cake takes so long to cook.. or the fact that selective breeding means nothing in here - swift and burly body male.. runner and workaholic breeds a blank. or a pal who is clumsy.. random stat gain?

You make Pal Spheres and (if you've got the firepower) go out and get some pals of your own to help with the next hunt. Log-off penalties are steep if you have multiple bases of the titular pals performing labor for you, but it's nothing some freshly made drugs can fix.All in all, if you want a good time for cheap in this day and age of the $70 triple A game, and want to assist a miracle game while you're at it, Palworld may be for you.;Recommended;778;64.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;ligit what i wanted in a game;Recommended;23;38.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;i understand this game has a successful first week but somethings are just unacceptable in any game and these were from my personal experience...*server crash/lagged when few players are nearby*hackers are a lot in official servers and usually k.o every pal in the vicinity or stuff your inventory and crash you*most official servers are players made, so you'll find yourself kicked or banned just because you didn't say hi or replied... in another word, your whole progression is in the hand of some kid*the dumbest thing ever where if you want to join your friend world you start from level 1, not even inventory or character stats are shareable between friends worlds, in short... you're pretty much playing a single player pure sandbox game;Not Recommended;621;6.1;

Tough luck.Guild mates help, but with this bug, the myriad of others, plus hackers blowing up bases, Its fun wears off quick.This game has the potential to be one of the best of all time when they fix it and add more features.I'll come back when its updated more and wish them all the success.;Recommended;494;94.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"""Pokemon Islands"" aka PalworldДаже при наличии десятков багов игра такая же вкусная,как чипсы с газировкой в детстве.К сожалению чуть позже вы узнаёте их состав и вам становится уже не так вкусно.Но для хайпа достаточно и онлайн оправдан.Играть первое время действительно достаточно весело.Если игра вам сразу зашла, то скорее всего вы залипните в ней 10-20, а то и 30+ часов.Мне зашла не сразу, но потом вроде пошло бодрее. Игра проста и прямолинейна:Ловишь покемонов и заставляешь их работать/возить тебя/биться вместе с тобой.Чем дальше - тем больше нужно копать ресы, а это уже на любителя.После 35лвл на х1 вас ждёт чистый гринд и дрочь процентов.Да, по первости покемоны мимимишные, но в игре нет никакой истории и диалогов с ними, так что постепенно они все превратятся просто в болванки разной степени полезности.Сразу на запуске игры вам дают много вариантов - как изучать игру - строиться соло/коопе на своём сервере или идти на чужой или вообще на 24/7мир сервера?Соло в эту игру могут наверное дротить только фанаты, ибо субъективно мне стало быстро скучно, т.к. мир хоть и большой и где-то идёт ротация биомов и покемонов, что радует, конечно, но в большинстве своём мир просто большой и пустой.Да, бродят покемончики, но достаточно рандомно, просто раскиданы по чуть-чуть в рамках своих биомов. Данжи совершенно уродские, я бы даже сказал ублюдские = Кривые развилки и нет миникарты, действительно, зачем игроку делать удобно.Насладиться сетевой игрой в полной мере не смог, т.к. до ближайшего стабильного московского сервера у меня пинг 130 минимум. С падениями до 150+, что уже создаёт микролаги, а доходя до 170 начинает дёргать персонажа при движении.Общему визуалу и анимациям тоже можно дать десятку = тут всё сделано приятно и удобно, замечаний нет. Есть вопросы по скейлам покемонов относительно друг друга, но это уже другой разговор.Про анимации атак монстров можно порассуждать, бывает по-разному и не всегда по дефолту всё красиво, но тут упирается в расчёт кулдаунов самим игроком и при желании любому монстру можно настроить красивую и грамотную ротацию из родных+выученных скиллов, чтобы он не зависал в ожидании неправильно выстроенных КД своих скиллов.Самая слабая часть это сетевой код и ИИ = именно эти две вещи пока что портят впечатление от игры и ломают погружение, т.к. они чрезвычайно плохи.Покемоны, располагаемые вами на базе - даже имея совсем примитивный список возможностей - умудряются ломаться и творить всё что угодно, кроме своей ""работы"". Застревают в текстурах, просто ломаются и стоят без дела и т.д. ещё десяток видов неадекватного поведения при том, что у них обычно всего 1-2-3 задачи максимум.Боевые поки тоже постоянно пытаются везде застрять и в принципе творят разную дичь в зависимости от рандома своих скиллов (благо хотя бы это настраивается, но до этого надо ещё дойти).Ну и соответственно чем больше покемон - тем скорее он где-нибудь застрянет и начнёт там стоять ""плакать"" - голодать, депрессовать и т.д.Итого - если отсутствие истории/квестов/диалогов не мешает вам наслаждаться игрой и вам достаточно покемонов со стройкой - смело берите и долбитесь, игра даже на этом уровне разработки игра норм, пойдёт.Более полный обзор можете почитать у тех, кто уже докачался на х1 до максимума, я пока в сомнениях, не готов просто гриндить, мотивации игра даёт недостаточно.";Recommended;2819;56.1;

Есть вопросы по скейлам покемонов относительно друг друга, но это уже другой разговор.Про анимации атак монстров можно порассуждать, бывает по-разному и не всегда по дефолту всё красиво, но тут упирается в расчёт кулдаунов самим игроком и при желании любому монстру можно настроить красивую и грамотную ротацию из родных+выученных скиллов, чтобы он не зависал в ожидании неправильно выстроенных КД своих скиллов.Самая слабая часть это сетевой код и ИИ = именно эти две вещи пока что портят впечатление от игры и ломают погружение, т.к. они чрезвычайно плохи.Покемоны, располагаемые вами на базе - даже имея совсем примитивный список возможностей - умудряются ломаться и творить всё что угодно, кроме своей ""работы"". Застревают в текстурах, просто ломаются и стоят без дела и т.д. ещё десяток видов неадекватного поведения при том, что у них обычно всего 1-2-3 задачи максимум.Боевые поки тоже постоянно пытаются везде застрять и в принципе творят разную дичь в зависимости от рандома своих скиллов (благо хотя бы это настраивается, но до этого надо ещё дойти).Ну и соответственно чем больше покемон - тем скорее он где-нибудь застрянет и начнёт там стоять ""плакать"" - голодать, депрессовать и т.д.Итого - если отсутствие истории/квестов/диалогов не мешает вам наслаждаться игрой и вам достаточно покемонов со стройкой - смело берите и долбитесь, игра даже на этом уровне разработки игра норм, пойдёт.Более полный обзор можете почитать у тех, кто уже докачался на х1 до максимума, я пока в сомнениях, не готов просто гриндить, мотивации игра даёт недостаточно.";Recommended;2819;56.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"For me this is one of those games that i really want to like, but I can't.The issue is not bugs, this is in preview and the devs are actively working on fixing issues, and game is perfectly playable as it is now.My problem is complete lack of story, you have some random pieces of people's diaries scattered around the world and when you read them it feels like you are reading the tutorial.Other thing is amount of violence, everything everywhere wants to kill you, you live with your ""pals"", but you will butcher them because you cannot let them go, sell them on the market (or black market), kill them for drops or essence, sacrifice them to level up yourself or other pal.The game sometimes feels like mix of everything Conan, Gatcha mobile games, Pokemon of course, tower defense and so on.Things I would like to see getting changed:- Butchering your pal? I mean wtf... can't I just let it go- Remove gatcha-style nonsense, just let us level up our pals, we can combine them which is super nice- Add some proper story to the game, and build your world to have a background- Why there's a village that looks like it suffered nuclear disaster, but there is a guard in shine equipment and everything, where the hell did he get that gear??- I start with a club and then end up with a grenade launcher, why do I even need so much weapons, I have my pals they are far more powerful then me- English translations are just weird, there's a skill called ""Pacifist"" and that gives you like -15% attack, or Sunten Lover which give you 10% fire resistance... common....I hope the game will take a turn to something that is deeper then what it is now, because otherwise it's going to become a shallow PvP crap";Not Recommended;1392;31.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I don't get the hype around this game. It's just a typical survival game but they ripped off a bunch of different games and slapped the name palworld on top. I'd not bother with this asset flip if I were you.;Not Recommended;168;0.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Just because the opposition with firearms may have the upper hand doesn't mean you cant use your fox friend as a flamethrower to commit horrific war crimes, in fact the game encourages this;Recommended;157;30.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;As someone who has played the Pokémon franchise since its beginning, I can say that there are similarities between Palworld and Pokémon, if anything needs to change it will likely be a few pal designs if anything.I have enjoyed the game thus far and look forward to seeing the upcoming features.I will update this review if I can as the game updates.;Recommended;289;33.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Palworld has become my next gaming addiction. I was veeeeery hesitant to play it at first as I thought it was gonna be some cheap knock off of Pokemon; a game that would never catch fire and would be a complete flop but I was proven very wrong. This game has become amazingly popular and after playing it for quite a few hours I can see why. As an adult, it feels so good going back into the world of ""Pokemon"" and to be able to play with friends? That makes it even greater. You can have your Pals help you in crafting, building, breeding, traversal and so much more. The Pals are very unique in a lot of ways and boss battles spread out in the map are a great challenge not including the tower/trainer battles that you can do as well! If Pokemon, Ark and Minecraft had a baby this would be it. I cannot praise this game enough and I wish someone had made a game like this sooner. The devs are very responsive to the feedback they have received and have done updates, fixes and are even going to make a road map for future content. Worth the price and is a fantastic game for either solo or co-op.";Recommended;886;23.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I'm going to go against the grain here. This game has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of potential, but I think the hype is just because it is doing what Nintendo failed to ever do, and that is release a Pokemon PC game.The inventory management in this game is one of the worst I've ever seen, even with the craft from storage being built in. You will basically live encumbered or be at the risk of being encumbered... ALL OF THE TIME. By the time you put your gear on, and 4 food slots (lol) you will be halfway to encumbered, and thats if you put 5 or so points in encumbrance. yea, its early access, and bugs will be expected (there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton, esp in terms of pals,) but in its current state, and as a person has has never played pokemon, its just another early access survival game. They took pretty much zero lessons from previous games, other than the craft from storage.Get rid of the encumbrance and just give us a set number of inventory slots that we can upgrade, and the game will be way more bearable.... kind of like what Enshrouded did.On positive note, the world is pretty, the game runs very smooth, and the pals are a unique add to a survival game (once they get them fixed.);Not Recommended;953;118.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Do you like Pokemon, Valheim, Arc, Breath of the Wild, Fortnite, and a bit of Elden Ring? If you take (mostly the good) aspects from all of those games, add a touch of enslavement, and smash them into one, you get Palworld. It works shockingly well.;Recommended;204;26.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I recently purchased Palworld with high hopes and expectations, only to be met with a series of disappointments that have left me regretting my decision. Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance Nightmares:Palworld is plagued with consistent performance issues. From random crashes to frustrating lag spikes, the technical aspects of the game are nothing short of a nightmare. It's disheartening to see a game with so much potential fail to deliver on the most basic level of functionality.Gameplay Bugs Galore:The gameplay is riddled with bugs that not only disrupt the flow of the game but also make it practically unplayable at times. Characters glitching through walls, AI companions behaving erratically, and quests failing to progress properly are just a few examples of the numerous bugs that hinder the gaming experience.Graphics That Leave Much to Be Desired:Palworld boasts about its visuals, but the reality falls far short of expectations. The game is filled with graphical glitches, awkward animations, and poorly rendered textures that make it hard to immerse oneself in the supposed beauty of the game world.Online Woes:Attempting to play Palworld online is an exercise in frustration. The connectivity issues are persistent, leading to frequent disconnections that disrupt any attempt at cooperative play. It's baffling that such a fundamental aspect of the game has been overlooked or poorly executed.Lackluster Customer Support:When seeking assistance for these myriad issues, the customer support team's responsiveness is shockingly inadequate. Messages go unanswered or receive generic, unhelpful responses, leaving players stranded with no solutions in sight.In conclusion, Palworld has proven to be a regrettable purchase. The combination of technical problems, gameplay issues, and subpar graphics makes it difficult to recommend this game to anyone seeking an enjoyable gaming experience. Save your money and invest it in a title that lives up to its promises.;Not Recommended;1695;9.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Personally I'm finding this to be a absolute stunner of a game. I quite enjoy a good Survival Crafting game, and the introduction of creatures into the game play has been amazing. I remember playing Pokemon Red way back and enjoying it but never feeling the need to 'collect them all'. This isn't the case with PalWorld, I'm constantly looking for new Pals that will improve my base. I desperately want to collect them all this time. Then there's the way that they all behave different in combat. It's just a great game design. Sure they've used game mechanics from other games but they're almost all good game mechanics and they combine into an exceptional game.And then you remember that this is early access and it's still not even finished. If it's this good at this stage I can't wait to see what the final version is like.Honestly I thought I'd be playing the new 'Like a Dragon' game at the end of January, sadly it will have to wait I'm enjoying this one too much.Fantastic game, only £25, even if you doubt my review, at £25 you've at least got to try it to see if I'm right.;Recommended;886;39.5;

Capitalism is key and i don't think those communist developers like it all too much, OH yeah i meant say REALLY good game. well priced, i hope they keep up with the community and don't act like infinity ward with a ton of pay to win micro trans-actions.;Recommended;384;148.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;On the outside it looks like Pokemon with guns.But in reality it has taken concepts from so many other games, good concepts, and worked them into a unique (and as of yet unpolished) masterpiece.;Recommended;161;38.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I haven't played too much yet, but so far it hasn't let down even with the hype surrounding the game. I have just recently spotted the forest giant. Tales of yor speak of it weakness to multiple campfires...Tales from me will tell you three is not multiple enough...;Recommended;219;13.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The game is a very fun game, yes it has crashes, but that is totally normal for a game that is on early release.also people who say this looks like Pokemon the pals may give you that look a like feeling, this game play is nowhere close to Pokemon. Pokemon doesn't build, craft or have guns, there's no survival in Pokemon. palworld is palworld. love the game, i'm super excited to keep playing.;Recommended;322;32.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is the pokemon game that we all wanted for years, but Nintendo never made it. some bugs here and there but it is early access so its to be expected, graphics are quite good character models are nice and unique enough.I do wish the game had more of a story to it something to make me feel for the characters in there so far it feels a bit soulless on that part NPCs and different factions of humans are present but none really mean or represent anything. I know im picking up lore collectibles throughout the game but i never stopped to pull them up and read what they say.Would be nice to actually get cutscenes and full voiced dialogue between characters and such, maybe after the huge success of Palworld now the devs can look at improving the game in that way as well.Overall i highly recommend it 48 hours in and this is a game you can easily put 100 to 200 hours for a survival building game.;Recommended;732;53.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Let me begin by saying that I did not follow this game at any time during it's early development. I only heard of it about a couple weeks ago from family. I still was uninterested when looking into it...then I received it as a gift from my brother. This game has surprised me by how quickly I can get lost in it, the map is huge, and there is actually rewards to motivate players to continue playing. I appreciate how they don't throw technology points out so upgrading the base takes time. This game is like a Pokemon and Harvest moon/Stardew Valley mix. There are some bugs but that I have run in to but none that were game breaking or where I had to restart the game. I have been playing in co-op mode with my brothers and they have run in to a couple bugs where they had to restart but considering it's still being developed we can deal with it.;Recommended;687;33.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;100 Hours In and Loving the Game!The GoodThe game play is very engaging. From the very start, you're given simple tasks that clearly teach you to play the game and all the resources in the starter zones required for success. As you progress through the early levels into mid game, the Pals get stronger, better abilities, and you get some really big quality of life once you're in the zone where pals are around level 20, Looking into late game and clearing each of the towers was a blast, though more challenging than I initially expected. I cleared them all solo, and with a group of friends. The tower fights do scale up with more players added so if that is your plan, make sure everyone can pull their weight! The base building is a lot of fun and gives strong utility to the player. You won't get far without a good base so take the time to optimize!As it is with most early access games there are some bugs. Big ones in this case but I will start by saying something that most other games do poorly that Palworld did well. After 100 hours of game play, I haven't crashed a single time. Until we built our Palbox on a 2x2 foundation, my Pals would render in and fall through the world. This caused them to become starving, injured, and the requirements to fix these things started to add up. The base size limit while enough, should be expandable in the server settings. It forces you to cramp base elements in. The Pal team assigned to tasks at your base will for the most part perform as intended, but they will need constant attention so they do not get stuck outside the base, against a wall, or between building elements like the farm and a feed box. The task management REALLY needs an interface. I say this because you have pals that are often proficient in more than one skill. It would be handy to be able to assign them to a task rather than picking them up and throwing them at a task and hoping they stick to it, because they often don't. If we were able to assign a task priority through a menu, or that podium workstation, it would give a huge quality of life bump at base!- Build one main base with everything in it. Optimize and upgrade your pals often.- Use Base 2 and 3 as fast travel to key resource nodes- Pick one island and stick to it until you've caught 10 of everything. This will help you level up faster and ensure you do not get over your head too quick. It will also ensure you have enough pals to upgrade the pal with the best perks passive skill at least once!- Breed as soon as you're able. There are hundreds of guides and spreadsheets out there for how to make two early pals produce a higher tier, otherwise late game pal.- Never pass a life effigy, You need more than you'd think to hit level 10 capture strength- When in combat with a boss let your Pals fight on their own, their aim is better. If you see an enemy winding up an attack, recall your pal so they don't take the damage!- Dungeons are mostly the same, enjoy them a few times then sprint through to the end for the exp ticks.- Capture a Pal Merchant as soon as possible so you can have access to a shop from your base!;Recommended;2533;123.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Now, obviously this feels like generic copyright infringement that would only be fun for its knock-offness at a glance. However, it really reminds me of one of my other favorite games, ARK, which has a lot of similar mechanics. This has been surprisingly fun and great to play with friends.;Recommended;241;100.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game is a blast.Pals have a bit of a pathing issue around your base but quickly taking them in and out of your base party will reset them.The gameplay itself has been engaging and not as easy as my first impression.;Recommended;175;27.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;(This is a review from just 3 hrs in so see it as a first impression)It went beyond my expectations, a very fun survival/base building game with an open world to explore with tower bosses that aren't too easy nor too hard.Pro's- Very beginner friendly, the game does a great job teaching you what you have to do in the tutorial section.- Rich open world for resources and many suitable locations to start base building- Excellent controller supportCons- Movement feels a little bit clunky sometimes- I have no other con to add. Hi!Overall it's a great experience and i can see me playing this for hours, after experiencing the game for myself I also believe Nintendo won't have a case against this game, the only similar thing is that you capture them with balls. And just a handful of designs that are unique enough to distinguished as it's own.;Recommended;698;8.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is so fun to play with a friend and messing around. The game mechanics of control is pretty easy as well. Hope it gets even crazier updates in the future. Overall I am having apot of fun playing Palworld.;Recommended;174;22.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game is a blast.Pals have a bit of a pathing issue around your base but quickly taking them in and out of your base party will reset them.The gameplay itself has been engaging and not as easy as my first impression.;Recommended;175;27.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;(This is a review from just 3 hrs in so see it as a first impression)It went beyond my expectations, a very fun survival/base building game with an open world to explore with tower bosses that aren't too easy nor too hard.Pro's- Very beginner friendly, the game does a great job teaching you what you have to do in the tutorial section.- Rich open world for resources and many suitable locations to start base building- Excellent controller supportCons- Movement feels a little bit clunky sometimes- I have no other con to add. Hi!Overall it's a great experience and i can see me playing this for hours, after experiencing the game for myself I also believe Nintendo won't have a case against this game, the only similar thing is that you capture them with balls. And just a handful of designs that are unique enough to distinguished as it's own.;Recommended;698;8.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;If you want to grind over hundreds of hours just for your save file to disappear and lose all your things then this is the game for you;Not Recommended;108;138.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Great game, has some flaws but for being in beta it is more complete than most AAA titles.;Recommended;73;164.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Super fun game, map is HUGE! Played this non stop for like a week now and I still haven't been able to catch them all. Its what a pokemon game should be. There's a few gripes with the alpha like the need to be able to assign your little creatures to work at a certain station and not run around not doing what you told it to do and once you hit level 40 its gets damn near impossible to catch anything high level wtihout spending 20 balls that take a ton of mats to craft but Im sure theyll level it out a bit. Once they add some sort of story line this is going to be a masterpiece of a game.;Recommended;471;99.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is just a fun game. It ticks the survival genre for me, the art style is nice. I have always been a big fan of pet classes in mmo's and this is ticking that box for me as well. I never cared about Nintendos version which does kind of surprise me about this game and me liking it.Now it is currently in early access and there are lots of bugs that your going to have to deal with but overall this is a wonderful start to this game. I do believe the game is just going to continue to get better. Overall, I think its worth the current price and I am satisfied with my purchase.;Recommended;464;75.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Alright, so I'll try and make a genuine review that isn't just ""Pokémon with guns"", even though it's accurate.In the 37 hours I've played (at the time of writing), I really enjoyed Palworld... Up to a point. The early game is amazing and fun. After about 10-20 hours, it gets a bit grindy. Not necessarily a bad thing, but when I have to grind for what is in this case early-mid game materials, I'm not having a great time.The balancing is flawed, but not by a lot. There's a lot that needs to be changed though, that's for sure. These are the things that bother me at the top of my head:Iron is fine to get when you don't need much, but when you want to build say a fortress made out of iron, it'd be nice if I could automate the farming process . As a trade-off, since the material is scarcer, that process could be slower.Balancing of stat points are honestly some of the worst. Some parts are fine, like HP, which increases by 100 flat points each time, but what amount of weight you can carry and the amount of added damage you can do is unbalanced and horribly unbalanced respectively. Only 50 extra weight per point? Disappointing, especially since it's a diminishing increase, relatively. 2 extra damage per point, from the baseline 100? So a 2% increase? Awful (in my opinion).Is it worth the money in it's current state? I think so. Is it also worth waiting until more updates come out (assuming the price of the game doesn't change)? Also yes.The game is definitely in early access, that much is obvious. But Palworld is off to a strong start.";Recommended;1271;37.3;

And of course the whole ""Pokemon"" (yeah I said it) aspect of the game simply appeals to peoples' nostalgia.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"It was a mild Sunday evening, the light from the setting sun glinted through the trees as I finished building my first base consisting of a small hut, workbench, and storage chest. I had not yet caught a pal yet as I was savouring the moment until I had established myself in this new world.As I finished construction of my new bed, I noticed what appeared to be a cloud out of the corner of my eye through the window of my hut. The felt odd as it was a little lower than my subconscious would expect a cloud to be, thus garnering my attention. I set out over the hill next to my base to investigate what I had seen, and sure enough, after making my way through some berry bushes, I came to a small clearing with a small round, woolly pal grazing. I would later come to know this pal as no. 1, Lamball but initially I was too excited to notice as I took my opportunity and threw one of the 3 pal-balls I had constructed. I eagerly waited with baited breath as I saw the indicator tick, 34%... shake... 87%... shake 100%... DING! Lamball was mine.I rushed back to my base and assigned my new pal to the base, and off he went to pick up some stones on the ground and store them in my chest. I instantly fell in love with my new chirpy companion and decided to name him Chunks as he resembled a chunk of cloud in my first sighting of him.What transpired is what I like to remember as the ""good times"". Me and my new best friend Chunks did everything together, from going on adventures, to catching new pals, I would even take leisurely strolls around my base with him to ensure that all was well with him and the rest of the pals currently working on my base. He seemed happy, the other pals seemed happy, I was happy. Chunks was and still is the only pal I have every renamed, and ever will, he meant that much to me.Some time after reaching level 22 I remember returning to base to repair my gear and noticed Chunks had an ulcer! I was distraught and immediately set about crafting the relevant medical remedy for such an illness. With the medicine administered he returned to peak performance and was bouncing about again as usual, thank god.It was merely only a few days later however that again problems ensued. I returned back from a dungeon run to find Chunks now had a fracture! God know how he managed to do it but I dove back to action and curated a medicine specifically designed to sure fractures and administered it. He was thankful, and so was I, Chunks meant everything to me at this point and nothing made me happier than seeing him bounce around without a care in the world, life was good.Then it happened, the fateful day that will harrow me to my core for the rest of my life. After a good nights sleep one morning I arose to my base, I had woke up a little late is seemed as the pals were already hard at work. I conducted my usual morning rounds and everything was in order other then Chunks, he wasn't there, this never happened so I went looking for him not thinking too much of it. After touring all the usual spots I would find him I grew more concerned as he was still missing, I began to look elsewhere int he base checking every nook and cranny I could find and couldn't find him anywhere! At this point it was nearly sundown and I was stricken with grief, until I thought of one place I had not looked, under the small bridge connecting two rocky parts of the base together. I ran there as fast as I could and there he was, stuck in the supports of the bridge. I quickly helped him down and went to cuddle him and say sorry, but he shrugged me off...I checked Chunks' status and I saw a word I never thought I would see under his name, ""Depressed"". I tried to console him and get a better understanding of why he was depressed, surely he can understand that I tried everything to find him, this wasn't deliberate, what can I do to make it up to him. I tried again and again but nothing seemed to appease him. I just wasn't good enough anymore...I went for a long walk that evening to think about life and Chunks, what we had been through and what was to come. I went to a very dark place, a place I don't think I could ever go again. That evening, on that walk, I didn't just see red, I saw black...The hour was nearing midnight, I woke up Chunks from his slumber and gently raised him to his feet and held his hand, ""Come on buddy, lets take a little walk down to the water, maybe we will both find what we are looking for there."" I whispered as my sleepy eyed best friend let me lead the way.After a few minutes of walking through the nearby forest we got to a lake, the view was beautiful at this time of night, the moonlight bounced across the water like Chunks used to bounce across my base. We stood there for a while just looking out at the water in silence just taking it all in.Chunks eventually got interested in why we were here and looked up at me, eyes still a little glazed from sleep, he saw me, looking out across the lake, tears running down my cheeks. He saw me, brandishing a butchers knife, sobbing at what I was about to do. He saw me, giving him the sweet release from this life he wanted so bad. He saw me, covered in his blood, covered in his tears.Apparently you can also make medicine to cure depression, who knew!10/10 would butcher loved ones again.";Recommended;4291;31.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has more thought constructed into it than most recent Pokemon launches. It's a shame that AAA games have been in a constant decline when it comes to quality and enjoyment and it took Palworld to demonstrate that.While this game is one of the best Early Releases I've ever seen, there are some issues with it:-The AI of the pals can be very glitchy, even after the recent AI patch-Structure placement doesn't always detect an open space properly-XP grind is almost entirely based on catching 10 of each pal-Multiplayer lag and visual glitchesOverall, Palworld is worth a try and I have high hopes to see it thrive.;Recommended;516;53.3;

We stood there for a while just looking out at the water in silence just taking it all in.Chunks eventually got interested in why we were here and looked up at me, eyes still a little glazed from sleep, he saw me, looking out across the lake, tears running down my cheeks. He saw me, brandishing a butchers knife, sobbing at what I was about to do. He saw me, giving him the sweet release from this life he wanted so bad. He saw me, covered in his blood, covered in his tears.Apparently you can also make medicine to cure depression, who knew!10/10 would butcher loved ones again.";Recommended;4291;31.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Being fully honest the world is super copy paste and empty for the most part, boss fights are not even all the fun if were being real here. Super annoying having to spam do the same 4 materials just to make pokeballs that then proceed to fail 9 times a row cause rng is cheeks even with max efficentcy from the status you get in the world.;Not Recommended;273;52.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has more thought constructed into it than most recent Pokemon launches. It's a shame that AAA games have been in a constant decline when it comes to quality and enjoyment and it took Palworld to demonstrate that.While this game is one of the best Early Releases I've ever seen, there are some issues with it:-The AI of the pals can be very glitchy, even after the recent AI patch-Structure placement doesn't always detect an open space properly-XP grind is almost entirely based on catching 10 of each pal-Multiplayer lag and visual glitchesOverall, Palworld is worth a try and I have high hopes to see it thrive.;Recommended;516;53.3;

While I understand that it is in early access, the lag can be terrible (even on ""Very Low"" settings) with some bugs and crashes here and there. I'd like to personally see towns and cities full of side quests and hidden secrets to discover.Additional Notes:*There is a definite need for a minimap in the bottom right corner!*As of 1.40, there is Japanese text whenever preparing to throw a Sphere (showing the right-click on the mouse to cancel action, playing in English)*More customization and expanded base building, please! (Being able to paint/change colors, more furniture, different styles of walls/roofs/etc., ladders/spiral staircases?)*Stream-line some of the game menus, notably in the ""Party"" tab - you should see each Pal's stats/moves/abilities without having to click directly on them and unless I'm mistaken, there is no way to look at others afterwards besides switching tabs?*Idea: Minigames/more ways to interact and possibly bond/have friendship levels with Pals!";Recommended;870;30.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Worth the money for sure. It does everything other mentioned games in the past could have done but didn't. I'm waiting for the actual ending but what I've played from a purely gameplay standpoint has been great and I can't wait for more content including pals to come. As far as improvements go, though i am a grindoholic I'd enjoy seeing more content in between each upgrade to make it seem worth it. Ususally any upgraded bench would allow for a new weapon or ball to be made for now. The capture rates as shown on screen could probably also stand for a visual nerf. As many people have seen consistent 90% chance of capture pals escaping from capture. I'm also looking forward to improved pathfinding for the pals in your base. Those are my only gripes about this and I'm sure they're temporary. As far as all the whining online about this, noone cares about clickgagement ragebaiting enough to not enjoy this game if they're a survivalcraft fan.;Recommended;781;59.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is an excellent game and the developers have done a splendid job. Honestly, the bugs are hardly noticeable, and truthfully, capturing, crafting, and base-building, along with the engaging locations, are all enjoyable and well thought out elements. The game has good progression, except for breeding, which can be a bit overpowered at times. However, overall, I highly rate this game. The developers have clearly invested considerable effort into every aspect, and each time I play, there's something new I find or a new method I discover for accomplishing tasks. It's fantastic with friends and truly deserves the praise it has received. From one indie developer to another, well done, you've smashed it Pocketpair!;Recommended;607;52.3;

Lag on private servers and official servers, even with low population count2. Limited character creation. They need more hairstyles and faces.3. Base building is still buggy: cant put furniture down in the exact centre of two tiles, can't have a roof overhead when placing cabinets, etc4. Enemy pathing needs work, enemies get stuck on terrain a lot.5. No storyline: feels like there's supposed to be one, but there are very few NPCs around the world and even the boss tamers don't really say much.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is a very fun game in it you enslave the innocent wildlife, force them to work for you and fight for you, make sure they know they can be replaced, and if they do a good job building everything for you they can get a one berry to eat for the rest of the week.;Recommended;213;28.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Classic pocketpair chaos: immensely fun but highly unpolished.PROS:1. Active combat lets you and your pals fight together.2. Base building is fun3. Fun multiplayerCONS:1. Lag on private servers and official servers, even with low population count2. Limited character creation. They need more hairstyles and faces.3. Base building is still buggy: cant put furniture down in the exact centre of two tiles, can't have a roof overhead when placing cabinets, etc4. Enemy pathing needs work, enemies get stuck on terrain a lot.5. No storyline: feels like there's supposed to be one, but there are very few NPCs around the world and even the boss tamers don't really say much. Not sure if this is getting added later or something;Recommended;606;23.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"All memes aside, this game is way more than ""pokemon with guns"". The survival element is well made, isn't too hard, ad doesn't seem super useless or unmanageable. The capturing system is more than just ""catch and use to fight"". You're rewarded for catching more, combine them, breed them, gain exp for multiple catches, etc.Progression is very satisfying. Leveling isn't too difficult, but you do have to allocate your stat points and technology points strategically. Again though, not extremely detrimental to your gameplay either way.The building leaves a little to be desired, but is still enjoyable and you can make nice things. I'm hoping for more building options like beams, dyes, more materials, etc.The map is huge, and fast travel points are free to use, once you discover them. There's a lot of them, too, but not everywhere so be prepared to explore! I'm excited for there to be more maps, too.Basically, just buy the game and get a friend or two to play with, or join a guild on a server. $30 for this game is an insanely low price, even in early access. If you like Ark, Valheim, The Forest, or any other survival game, you'll probably love Palworld. It takes a lot of elements from those, while also removing some of the more grindy elements of material gathering.Just get it and have fun spitting in the face of PETA";Recommended;1101;54.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This review is coming from about 60 hours of playing while the game's still in Early Access. I'll update the review as I progress and throughout future updates. I bought the game on release and I'm still enjoying it a lot.This game has a lot of positive things going for it, but be mindful that it is in Early Access, so things are subject to change. Also, be aware that the developer also created Craftopia, which is another EA game. I'm not saying that to dissuade people from getting the game -- I just hope the devs don't become too overwhelmed developing for both games.Controversy:I typically avoid delving too deep into toxic BS, but I wanted to address some things people have levied towards the game and its developers. Most of the people I've seen complain about the game come from bottom dwellers that exist on the cesspool of unbridled stupidity that is Twitter.People claim the game uses AI or stolen assets, which doesn't seem to be true. From what I've gathered, Steam has been cracking down on AI-related things, so I'm sure they would have said something by now if this game used AI in any way.People have also been using the term ""plagiarism"" in such ludicrous and, to be honest, defamatory ways. These people clearly do not understand what plagiarism actually is and I strongly recommend you not pay any attention to those thst claim the game ""plagiarizes"" designs. This is the most ridiculous claim I've seen so far. There are numerous pals that are heavily inspired by various Pokémon but to go as far as to say they're ""plagiarized"" is insane. That's also not the right way to use the word.I don't see that as a valid or worthwhile complaint.With all that being said, I enjoy the game. I'm usually not the type who enjoys survival or base building games, but I don't think the survival/base building elements are too difficult or challenging. Sure, it's annoying having to get all your stuff back once you die, but it's not that challenging from my perspective, especially since I'm a Soulsborne player.The story isn't phenomenal - it's kinda just ""there."" I'm sure the story will be expanded upon in future updates, so I won't comment on it for now. It isn't the selling point of the game anyway.I've seen people refer to the game as ""Pokémon with guns,"" which isn't exactly true. The gameplay is very similar to Legends Arceus, which is probably why I personally like the game so much.You build a base, catch creatures, and shoot people and other creatures.This is the game's most important aspect and probably why so many people enjoy the game.There are hundreds of pals to catch, so I'm sure people will have their favorites. I personally really like Pyrin Noct and Anubis.The devs are currently working on patching the game to fix bugs, so that's great. I can't speak for everyone, but the biggest bug I've encountered was getting stuck in terrain, which was recently patched.Subjective views of the game:I'm personally loving the game so far. I'm currently in the process of breeding powerful pals.The only thing I wish was different is probably to lower the cake requirements for breeding since it takes so long to get a pal with the passives you really want.";Recommended;2636;78.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is a mashup. Yup they have pokemon characters, but why wouldn't you want that, Pokemon are both aesthetically and culturally awesome. They borrowed all the best parts of all the survival and open world games you've played. It's a delightful highly accessible game with many hours of enjoyable play time, in whatever large or small chunks you want.It's not without issues, hopefully some get rectified as it goes through the EA process. But honestly most of them are pretty minor and ignoreable, especially from a small dev.;Recommended;445;61.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Very fun game to casually play it is early access so expect things to change in the future hopefully for the better. Playing solo I'm able to enjoy my time for 80 hours and more. It's not all action packed but there is plenty to do the game is great to play without any guides but I would recommend watching breeding guides around level 30! I think this game is more enjoyable with friends (The good and the bad) so give it a try if survival games is in your genre.;Recommended;375;88.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Honestly it is not like pokemon at all. It is a survival game that's like a combination of like genshin impact and dragon quest. You need food to survive, can die from code and it takes resources to fight with out your pals. Example to craft bows, guns, swords etc.;Recommended;216;77.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Sorry but this doesn't do it for me...

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"First few hours: I arrive at this beautiful world with only the cloths on my back. I see a fast travel monolith type thingy and engage it allowing me to return here if I die since i have no home. A man next to it gives me materials and advice. I leave to find a home site and pick up wood and stones as I search.Eventually I find berry bushes, a bunch of them and now i have food! I see a cute little furry creature...looks like a sheep, a Lamball ...looks harmless...level three...I'm level one. I run up to him and he ignores me. I hit him with my fists and it's a close fight but he beats me. (I stink at fighting in every game.) I die and spawn at the warp, and return to the scene of the mauling.I see another Lamball, a level one. I engage him and win, but i have no balls to catch him when he's weak. I fight two more and win and level up. I spot a few Pal Spheres lying on the ground and pick them up. Fight one more Lamball and catch him with the sphere! I throw him so i can use him, but he's very weak from my beating, but he's slowly regaining health. He has 2 of 3 active skills and one passive shill, none particularly good. When he's at full health, I attack a level three Lamball since I'm now level two and I have help. We murder the hapless creature and I jump off the couch in excitement.I find some more spheres, fight and capture another Lamball. this one has a passive ability called Brave making his attack 10% stronger and he's a level three! I realize that every Pal of the same species can be different and get very excited. But i still have no home! While picking up every single thing I find on the ground and punching a few trees for wood,I finally find a very flat area near a river and cliffs that's quite scenic, has many trees and a few nodes, and I build my first Primitive Workbench, then I fetch more materials which are everywhere to make my first set of tools and weapons. I check the technology tree and realize that I have points and enhance my health and weight. Plus I've unlocked two whole rows of items I can make! I They make everything so much easier!I notice that now I have a ""Build"" function and I build a small hut out of wood I collect with my new axe. I love it, but realize it's much too small when i go inside. I expand it and feel much less calaustrophobic. I build my Palbox and now I have a real base. I can now make spheres and spend 30 minutes getting the materials and making a bunch of them.The fighting is so addictive that I wander off to find more victims with my ""Brave"" Lamball. We find some cute Pals called Cattives and i catch a few. Lamball dies because these cats are tougher. I use one of them instead to fight and he's awesome.We run back home and I open my Pal box to store my pets. I make one of the Cattives a worker and he immediately starts mining stone nearby! I'm loving this! He's so cute and helpful! He smiles if I pet him! I go out hunting again and find a fox like creature called a Foxparks. I attack him with my Cattive and he shhots fore at us which really hurts. We both die. I spawn at home and grab another Cattive to try again. This time i use dodge and bring an extra Cattive. We engage the Foxparks and my forst Cattive dies while I dodge flames and realize I need that craft that bow at level 3 in the technology tree. I'm about to die so even though his health is still too high I throw A sphere and the random number Gods smile on me and i catch him!! I let his health recover and begin using him and he's wrecking anything close to our level!I'm having the time of my life! I catch a few more Pals and now it's become so much fun to check their abilites which are all different. I catch one which has a yellow passive skill called Artisan. It makes him work 50% faster! OMG! What other types of skills am I going to find on these wonderful creatures in this wonderful world!!? I head back to base to farm some more material because now I'm hooked.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Its a lot of fun, with a lot of the addicting aspects of Ark and other survival games but simplified and artistically different that seems to appeal to a broader audience. For early access it is very polished. Don't get me wrong there are still bugs but so far from my experience not enough to hinder my fun.;Recommended;251;52.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I think there are two groups of people talking about this game. The first group play the game and love it (for the most part). The second group see how popular Palworld has gotten and decide to spew hatred and level accusations to try and piggy back off of Palworld's popularity. Is there some validity to what the detractors say? Yes, every good lie has a grain of truth to it. But the reality of the situation is that 98% of the people speaking negatively about Palworld only do so because it's popular. The lies about using AI, the accusations of stealing pokemon designs, the accusations about stealing BotW designs/mechanics, none of this would have ever been seen or heard if Palworld had been even half as successful as they are. It would have just been an alright game that quickly faded into obscurity. I can likely close my eyes and randomly press buttons on any mobile app store for video games and I'd more than likely land on a game that is quite literally a lazy reskin of some other game. But where are all these righteous crusaders on these issues of plagiarism in spaces such as...lets say Vampire Survivors? That game, while popular in its own right, never broke out into the world at large. It suffers from dozens of other games (and likely hundreds of mobile games) taking inspiration as well some just ripping it off. Why aren't they defending Vampire Survivors from these copies? Or better yet, is Vampire Survivors simply copying another game of even less popularity that no one has heard of? Are they going to defend that original game? The answer to all accounts is no. Because its not popular enough and talking about it wont signal boost them for their ego trips. They did the same exact thing when BG3 blew up in popularity. The rando's on Twitter just wanted to get their tweets trending and the game dev's who smack talk it are threatened by its success and feel inadequacy over their own projects. In a world where CoD and sports games release basically the same product every year and still make a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money its already clear that winners in this market are not always picked rationally. Palworld gave people a Pokemon-style creature catcher in an open world environment with their own demented little spin on it. The market responded, and they loved it. The haters can cope and seethe all they want but all their faked righteous indignation is about as weak as their arguments are. Of course as always, this game is still early access. There will be issues and that is an acceptable reason to not want to buy or play the game until its been ironed out. Don't be afraid to criticize, the game isn't perfect. Like Pals randomly falling through the world and getting knocked out when I fast travel breaks my rhythm when I spend 30 minutes mass catching fire Pals to get one with a good worker trait and distill the extras into the one good one for extra work speed only to have it KO'd for something outside of my control. The loss of time from making the pal spheres alone is already annoying as it is. But overall it is a good game. Creatures to collect, map to explore, and plenty of materials to collect and base build with. That's all for now, give your lamball an AK and tell it to go commit some crimes and catch a Fuack and never use it because we don't give a Fuack.TL:DR - The game is fun, and if you also enjoy it than do so apologetically because most of the people who hate on it don't actually care about the BS issues they bring up. They just want their 15 minutes of fame by hating on a game that is incredibly popular.;Recommended;2922;42.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has helped get me out of a funk. I enjoy playing games again and my friends enjoy it too. We've had a lot to talk about. I think its one of the most well rounded concepts I've ever dabbled with. I look forward to seeing how it expands in the future. Keep doing what you're doing its working. Just needs patches. Damn Turtle pals keep getting stuck in my base haha.;Recommended;302;97.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;There's a surprising amount of things to do in the game despite just being in early access.The amount of Pals you can capture— around 111, and that's without the variants— as well as the amount of ground you can travel is really amazing, That, and the base building and resource management portion of the game really makes for a fun experience on paper.However, it's not really without its quirks. While Palworld boasts a great amount of decorations you can build for your base, the actual base building experience is horrendous. Assigning Pals to certain stations is also a pain at times, and there's the occasional bug where they stop doing their jobs when permanently assigned to a station (this is certainly apparent with breeding after fast traveling to another waypoint).After defeating all of the Tower bosses, there's really not much to do except capture the Legendary pals scattered around the world.The game still needs a bit of polish and QoL work at its certain state, but I do recommend people getting the game if they aren't deterred by such problems. Can't wait to see where this game goes!;Recommended;918;55.3;

The second group see how popular Palworld has gotten and decide to spew hatred and level accusations to try and piggy back off of Palworld's popularity. Is there some validity to what the detractors say? Yes, every good lie has a grain of truth to it. But the reality of the situation is that 98% of the people speaking negatively about Palworld only do so because it's popular. The lies about using AI, the accusations of stealing pokemon designs, the accusations about stealing BotW designs/mechanics, none of this would have ever been seen or heard if Palworld had been even half as successful as they are. It would have just been an alright game that quickly faded into obscurity. I can likely close my eyes and randomly press buttons on any mobile app store for video games and I'd more than likely land on a game that is quite literally a lazy reskin of some other game. But where are all these righteous crusaders on these issues of plagiarism in spaces such as...lets say Vampire Survivors? That game, while popular in its own right, never broke out into the world at large. It suffers from dozens of other games (and likely hundreds of mobile games) taking inspiration as well some just ripping it off. Why aren't they defending Vampire Survivors from these copies? Or better yet, is Vampire Survivors simply copying another game of even less popularity that no one has heard of? Are they going to defend that original game? The answer to all accounts is no. Because its not popular enough and talking about it wont signal boost them for their ego trips. They did the same exact thing when BG3 blew up in popularity. The rando's on Twitter just wanted to get their tweets trending and the game dev's who smack talk it are threatened by its success and feel inadequacy over their own projects. In a world where CoD and sports games release basically the same product every year and still make a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money its already clear that winners in this market are not always picked rationally. Palworld gave people a Pokemon-style creature catcher in an open world environment with their own demented little spin on it. The market responded, and they loved it. The haters can cope and seethe all they want but all their faked righteous indignation is about as weak as their arguments are. Of course as always, this game is still early access. There will be issues and that is an acceptable reason to not want to buy or play the game until its been ironed out. Don't be afraid to criticize, the game isn't perfect. Like Pals randomly falling through the world and getting knocked out when I fast travel breaks my rhythm when I spend 30 minutes mass catching fire Pals to get one with a good worker trait and distill the extras into the one good one for extra work speed only to have it KO'd for something outside of my control. The loss of time from making the pal spheres alone is already annoying as it is. But overall it is a good game. Creatures to collect, map to explore, and plenty of materials to collect and base build with. That's all for now, give your lamball an AK and tell it to go commit some crimes and catch a Fuack and never use it because we don't give a Fuack.TL:DR - The game is fun, and if you also enjoy it than do so apologetically because most of the people who hate on it don't actually care about the BS issues they bring up. They just want their 15 minutes of fame by hating on a game that is incredibly popular.;Recommended;2922;42.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has helped get me out of a funk. I enjoy playing games again and my friends enjoy it too. We've had a lot to talk about. I think its one of the most well rounded concepts I've ever dabbled with. I look forward to seeing how it expands in the future. Keep doing what you're doing its working. Just needs patches. Damn Turtle pals keep getting stuck in my base haha.;Recommended;302;97.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;There's a surprising amount of things to do in the game despite just being in early access.The amount of Pals you can capture— around 111, and that's without the variants— as well as the amount of ground you can travel is really amazing, That, and the base building and resource management portion of the game really makes for a fun experience on paper.However, it's not really without its quirks. While Palworld boasts a great amount of decorations you can build for your base, the actual base building experience is horrendous. Assigning Pals to certain stations is also a pain at times, and there's the occasional bug where they stop doing their jobs when permanently assigned to a station (this is certainly apparent with breeding after fast traveling to another waypoint).After defeating all of the Tower bosses, there's really not much to do except capture the Legendary pals scattered around the world.The game still needs a bit of polish and QoL work at its certain state, but I do recommend people getting the game if they aren't deterred by such problems. Can't wait to see where this game goes!;Recommended;918;55.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I will be honest, I don't USUALLY write reviews like this but I have to say it. This game IS good. It is!I thought when I first saw this game that it'd suck or even flop. But there is something about this game that will pull you in if you are a fan of survival-exploration/monster collection games.Is it perfect? Well, no, it's still in early development. But there is something here. Something that might blossom into something grand over the course of this year. There *has* been discourse about this game and originality. I'll admit, it definitely looks like games like Pokemon and Ark. BUT!To say that this game has no soul, is a *DEAD* lie. It has soul in spades and compared to modern gaming is like a breath of fresh air. All I have to say to the naysayers or people who checking out this game is play or watch a YouTube video and get your own opinion on Palworld.If you like it, that's okay. If you don't, that's also okay. But at the end of the day, this game accomplishes, at least in my opinion the one thing many, MANY games fail to do. And that's to be actually fun to play.;Recommended;883;36.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"As a long-time survival game enthusiast, I can confidently say that Palworld has completely blown me away with its innovative take on the genre. This game is a breath of fresh air in a market flooded with similar titles, and it's quickly become one of my all-time favorites.Having previously enjoyed the developers' game, Craftopia, I had high expectations for Palworld, and it certainly did not disappoint. Just like Craftopia, Palworld showcases the developers' incredible talent for crafting immersive and captivating gameplay experiences.The concept of having adorable creatures called ""Pals"" as your companions is simply genius. These critters are not just for show; they play an integral role in your survival and progression in the game. The way you can use them to carry items, build structures, and even engage in combat is both innovative and endearing. It adds a whole new layer of strategy to the survival experience, and I've grown genuinely attached to my Pals.Craftopia's influence is evident in the crafting and building mechanics of Palworld. They are top-notch, providing depth and complexity without feeling overwhelming. I love the variety of structures and items I can create, making my base truly unique. Plus, the world itself is breathtakingly beautiful, and I find myself constantly exploring new areas just to soak in the scenery.The combat system in Palworld is intense and engaging, just like in Craftopia. Fighting off hostile creatures and bandits with my trusty Pals by my side is incredibly satisfying. The variety of weapons and strategies you can employ keeps every encounter fresh and exciting.The developers have once again done an excellent job with the game's progression system, balancing challenge and reward perfectly. It feels so satisfying to see my character and Pals grow stronger as I continue to survive and thrive in the Palworld.I also appreciate the attention to detail and the humor scattered throughout the game, which was also a hallmark of Craftopia. It's evident that the developers put a lot of love and thought into creating this world, and it shows in every aspect of the game.In conclusion, Palworld is an absolute gem in the survival gaming genre. It offers a unique and refreshing experience that's both challenging and fun. If you've enjoyed Craftopia, you'll find Palworld to be a delightful continuation of the developers' incredible gameplay and development style. Highly recommended!";Recommended;2063;55.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Let me get off ans say this. The Game is addicting. I've had a hard time pulling myself away from it.The gameplay is a beautiful mix of Ark(Which I've never played before) and Pokemon. Takes both ideas and makes something new with it.Biggest Gripe right now though is the lack of Creative thought when coming up with Designs of characters and the assets used for the Project. Quite literally most the Assets they used are Default Unreal Assets. I would hope in the future that they take this, and make something Truly unique with it. It's Fun as is, but as now there are quite a few glitches in it. Just earlier today I fell through the map on my Mount and had a hard time getting back to the surface. Keep in Mind though this Game is in Early Access.I will say this much I have fell in love with some of the monster Designs. Katress caught my eye pretty Early along with Quivern. The Fact I can get a mount to ride my Pals Is enough for me to enjoy this game. I get to make a base, and Defend it.I would like a few things though.- Currently there is no way to favorite Servers. I currently Host a Server and every one of my Members has to Put in an IP manually because they can't find it in Search and it doesn't show up.- Some of the Designs are a bit too close to Pokemon. This may pose problems with Copyright laws and could cause problems down the line for them. Maybe make them a bit more of their own thing- Would like an administration Menu for Servers. Along with the ability to Lock certain Structures to be part of the Worlds Structures.Make Certain Chests to be accessible by all Players, and such.- A More stylized approach to the Landscape to match the models- More Customization for the Base Characters, along with some Clothing Options so Players can differentiate from each others when in Servers.- More Story. There is basically No Dialog in this game aside from the Little Notes that I don't read across the land.Overall I'd say my Experience from this game has been Pretty well. Would I suggest it to others. IT's a Mixed bag for that. It's not a game I would buy for others as I've done with Gmod and a Few other Games, but I'd say it's an alright game to try out. It's Definitely better with Friends.;Recommended;1806;105.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I recently dove into Palworld, and I have to say, it's an absolute gem of a game that exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by the stunning graphics.The unique blend of open-world adventure with survival and crafting elements kept me hooked for hours on end.The developers have done an incredible job in creating a vibrant, dynamic environment that encourages exploration and creativity. Whether it's building, battling, or breeding the pals, there's a sense of discovery and wonder around every corner. Palworld is a must-play.;Recommended;482;34.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Here comes a negative review oh boy. My review is for normal or casual players. If you like games like Rust or Ark or whatever you will probably like this game.BUT as of launch the game is a massive bug fest. Half of the pals passives don't work. the path finding is non existent in the management of your base so half the time your pals are stuck in somewhere. You can't close the motion blur even tho there is a setting for it which does nothing. Frankly I don't even know if other settings even do work. And if true catch rate bonuses actually downgrade your ability to catch.But lets say you can look over these bugs. The game world is uninspired, uninteresting. After playing for 3-4 hours of fun you will just ask -is this it?- and the answer is yes, yes it is. The world is basically empty, there are some dungeons which all look the same. Pals suffer the same fate.;Not Recommended;709;9.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I think the people that dislike Palworld being a ""Pokemon"" miss the fact that Pokemon games truly haven't changed their formula in 30 years. As time has passed, that wonder they held faded away, giving game after game of similar content,""but this time, on Venus!"" It gets old. And what Palworld does is recognize that this has happened. They're using the formula, but adding to it. Making it into a new game that holds nostalgia without ever having existed. And adding more only innovates a game that already was set up to succeed.Plus theres little guys little men and fellas that can be your friend";Recommended;496;21.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Other than the Pals being dumber than a box of rocks and acting like a toddler trying to kill themselves and you have to keep them alive (I'm sure this will be fixed with future updates and the Pals not randomly climbing on top of things and walking off them), this game is great!;Recommended;227;43.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Most enjoyable 60+ hours of gameplay and counting.Personal Opinion:To be honest I was kinda surprised that Palworld has sold not 1, not 2 but 7 Million copies in the span of 5 days! And if Twitter and some game journalist aren't happy about it, it's a good sign. But controversies aside, too lazy to react to it. Let alone wasting my time to dive deeper into their lake of salt tears.So yes, it is ""Pokemon with guns"" from the outside, but if you actually played it or at least take a glance at it's gameplay, it's more like a mix and match of ARK survival, Monster Hunter and Pokemon. Unlike in Pokemon, your Pals can assist you in your task like crafting, farming and battling other Pals, Bosses and some cult bandits like enemies. You can run a sweatshop with your Pals, use them to mine ores and more. Each Pals has it's own specific types and jobs which makes each one of them unique and fun to own either in early, mid or late game.The good stuff:You can catch Pals, make them work, make them fight, eat them, kill them or sell them to the Black Market.THERE IS bugs and glitches. Like a handful of them that I've seen so far.But it's not that seriously game breaking nor it's a mammoth ""Bethesda level"" of bugs and glitches That ""Just exist"".I give it a pass since I have a lot of fun with it and the devs promised to fix the bugs and glitches in their roadmap.Not to get anyone hopes high, but it looks promising so we just have to wait and see.Is it ""original""? No. And who cares.Is it fun? Yes, go ask the current 1 - 2 Million+ players who played it and their opinions.I highly recommend this game to PokeFans or any survival crafting genre fans.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld has yet to impress me with anything it does. The game runs okay but does have some performance issues, but hey, its EA. The combat is shallow. The Pal vs Pal stuff is okay, but the lack of control you have over what the pal does is non-existent. The base building is some of the clunkiest i have seen in a survival game. Multiple systems in running the base are also buggy.I know we don't really need to re-invent the wheel here and there are very few original ideas and concepts left to discover, but Palworld just seems to take a lot of existing systems and IPs and crudely smashes them together. I guess i see the appeal, but are we really this desperate for different pokemon? If so, there are better options than this.Let's see where Palworld is next year.;Not Recommended;629;6.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Its a really fun game and its even better to enjoy with your family or your buddies . I love the open world aspect with plenty of plains and mountains full of stuff to explore and stuff to do battles to be fought and pals to be put to hard work and labor for our amusement and relaxation ahahaha woo lets build stuff and kill ♥♥♥♥.;Recommended;266;5.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is the second time I've lost my game data, extremely unprofessional. i understand that every game has bugs and crashes, but have it happen twice so close together and early in the game doesn't make sense to me. the first i was maybe lvl 15, that data is gone. second try got myself to lvl 26 or 27. both times i didn't take advantage of any bugs or glitches, harass any other players, no cheating of any kind... but data is gone both times. No warning or anything, save data just disappeared. So no i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.;Not Recommended;444;59.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun for the first 2 days until it sets in just how much time you'll have to spend doing the same thing over and over and over just to take a step forward. Look forward to single player console commands actually being accessible so I don't have to wait until I'm on my deathbed to see level 20 or not die to every hostile thing without spending every resource just to stay alive. Lamball makes it all worth it though;Recommended;336;5.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game starts out great, seems very promising. The middle and end game is abysmal. You quickly realize there isn't much to do past level 30 because all there is to do is try breeding the perfect Pals and fighting bosses that aren't even a challenge or very interesting. Killing and fighting is not how you gain levels, catching pals is the only decent EXP you can earn. Per level you need to catch dozens upon dozens upon dozens to get even close to gaining enough experience to level up.You are bogged down past level 30 by needing a never ending flow of Ingots, which is basically what the entire game becomes. Farming enough ingots to produce more Spheres to catch more Pals to breed more Pals.It becomes mind-numbingly boring because the AI is so absolutely trash that no fight is ever even remotely entertaining. I captured an Anubis, one of the best end game Pals, I spent 15 hours breeding that Anubis into it's most perfect form, only to have it basically run into walls in every fight, attacking nothing. What's worse is every Pal does this to a degree. You throw your Pal into a fight, it runs around doing nothing, maybe attacking once every 15 seconds. In that same amount of time you can end the fight with your weapons 10x over.So, in essence, Pals are useless. And if the Pals are useless, what is the point of the game?This could be good in a few years once there is actual content and all of the stuff ironed out but for now it's just a joke of a game.;Not Recommended;1201;70.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Amazing game. You should get it for sure, even if its not your type of game, you should still get this game.;Recommended;87;103.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Really enjoying this game. The devs really nailed the exploration aspect to this. It is so much fun to just run around and find all kinds of different pals, bosses, loot and landscapes. It feels awesome to find and catch a rare pal, and the devs have basically manged to bottle that feeling and deliver it constantly. Also having guns in the game is great. The animations are fantastic and there is just real charm in the little things such as the *thunk* sound when you load a live penguin-like pal into a rocket launcher. Being able to just run and jump around with your favorite pals also makes for a top tier experience. The base building/automation could definitely use some work, but since it is early access, I have no problems with it as long as it gets less clunky when 1.0 is out.Overall, I would highly recommend this game as it is just a ton of fun. It scratches that open world exploration/survival itch I didn't even know I had been missing so much. That, on top of the joy of catching and picking out your favorite pals really just ties this game together really well. Can't forget the guns too :P. 9.5/10 game right now, and definitely a 10/10 once the bugs are worked out.;Recommended;972;78.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"For an early access game, it is incredible how fun and engaging Palworld is. Say what you will about the ""Pokemon with Guns"" meme, Palworld does enough right that even in this raw state, you will find yourself pouring hours and hours into it before delving into even deeper mechanics. Don't like how hard the game is? Tweak the world settings? Really want to make things wild?

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is incredible!! I purchased it because my friend was begging me to. I wasn't terribly interested and had very low expectations. I hopped on expecting to play for at most thirty minutes. I ENDED UP PLAYING FOR THE REST OF THE DAY!!! The entire game is beautiful!! The environment is gorgeous, the pals are super cute/majestic/cool, the movement feels amazing, its just amazing all around. I love how your pals can help around the base, how each pal has a specific job or role based on their abilities/type. I have never even left a review before, but I just had to for this game its amazing. In the last day it has become my easily third favorite game. The only down sides are the lack of customization for your character. (I believe zero long hair options [as of now] no height slider, and there are only preset faces you can choose from.), it is VERY easy to throw your pal spheres on accident, and you can't name your pals yet, however, Pal World is still in early development so I suspect these issues will be fixed shortly! (Writing this right now on 2/2/2024) There is still more I could say about this game, but you would most likely experience it yourself. Plus I really want to get back to playing. So in conclusion BUY PAL WORLD!!! <3;Recommended;1025;12.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Creates a quite unique experience with a feeling of a mix between games of different genres to make something pretty much unlike any other. This game feels like a lighter ARK while having a feeling of a collection/catching game with a bit of breeding for traits and other stuff which comes together into a game that is fun to get into and hard to put down. Honestly something I would recommend even if it is just to try it.;Recommended;345;77.3;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;After 100 hours of play on a rented server here are the thoughts I have:Palworld is truly a great game that I've enjoyed so far. It brings a tired genre to life with new ideas and concepts. While it isn't all rainbows and Univolts, this $30 game has far exceeded expectations. There are some improvements/QoL changes that I would like to see in the future:Allow players to customize more game settings like number of pals that can be working at a base, or changing player stats per point, etc.Improve building, especially clipping, or at least give us the option to turn off clipping prevention. This is a big one. One of my friend's and I's main frustrations is the lackluster building. Add more building pieces so we can have a bigger variety of buildings.Create a pal that passively generates the electric organs or give an existing one the ability.Put stat information in the blueprint descriptions to make it easier to keep track of them.Give us a recycling system for old gear.For now those are my main grievances at level 40.;Recommended;853;141.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Palworld: The Game That Turned My Virtual Farm into a Hilarious Animal UprisingIf you've ever dreamed of managing a farm, raising adorable creatures, and fending off unexpected chaos, Palworld is the game for you! This game takes the phrase ""farm life"" to a whole new level, and by level, I mean an explosion of laughter, tears, and flying pigs.First off, let's talk about the ""Pals"" – these aren't your typical farm animals. Sure, you have your cute sheep and chickens, but mix in some rabbits armed to the teeth with firearms, and you've got yourself a farm like no other. Watching your fluffy friends strategically maneuver through the fields while dual-wielding pistols is a sight to behold. Who knew a bunny with an AK-47 could be so endearing?The game's graphics are surprisingly good, but be prepared for the occasional explosion of feathers and fur when your Pals engage in a heated firefight. Forget about peaceful walks through the meadow; you'll be too busy dodging stray bullets and making sure your cornfields don't turn into a war zone.Now, let's address the resource management aspect. Farming was never this challenging – I mean, who needs a plow when you have a squad of heavily armed pigs? However, keep in mind that your corn harvest might be delayed if your Pals decide to stage a protest for better working conditions. Negotiating with a rebellious group of gun-toting rabbits and pigs? Welcome to Palworld!The multiplayer aspect adds another layer of chaos. Forget cooperating with other players to build the perfect farm – it's all about strategic alliances and betrayals. One moment you're trading carrots, and the next, your former ally is leading an army of armed ostriches to raid your potato stash. Friendship, indeed, has never been more fleeting.In conclusion, Palworld is an absolute blast for those looking to turn their peaceful farming fantasies into a hilarious and unpredictable adventure. Whether you're herding armed sheep or negotiating with militant bunnies, this game will keep you on your toes – and occasionally hiding in your virtual hay bale fort. Just be prepared for a few laughs, a lot of chaos, and the realization that farming was never meant to be this entertaining.";Recommended;1851;208.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;So, I feel like I've got a good grasp on this game.The worst part about this is that I'm reminded that franchises I loved growing up are not filling this space before a new IP does it.This game leaves me wishing that we had a new Monster Rancher. Pokemon has had multiple chances over the last decade to make something like this, and they don't. Dragon Warrior Monsters wishes it could even approach being this good. (Okay, I have a soft spot for that first game, and I love the series, but I'm the minority here)I have mixed feelings about base building/survival genre games, but this one feels like a game I've been wanting since the PSX/GBC era. This game is fantastic already and it's going to keep growing and getting better. That makes me excited.For being a game in early access it's actually very stable and fleshed out. There are AAA games that were released last year that can't match the performance of this (yes, I'm again complaining about Jedi Survivor, that game makes me sad).If you're a fan of survival games, monster raising games, or anything in between, you're likely going to enjoy this game. It's worth the buy if this type of thing is your jam.Now, I'm off to continue raising my dumbfaced Relaxasaur and stare at him stupidly wandering around with rocks and food in his mouth as I build assault rifles and enslave the trademark independent Team Rocket stand ins whenever they threaten a base.Man... I freaking love this game.;Recommended;1195;18.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The automation/base game play is broken. The exploration half of the game is very fun, and I thought the automation would facilitate and compliment that exploration nicely. Instead, due to all of the path-finding bugs and lack of a priorities menu, the automation actively STOPS you from exploring and having fun with your friends. I thought the automation would make it easier to get out of the house and get to the good stuff than in other survival games. Instead, I'm base standing more than ever trying to wrangle this idiotic AI.;Not Recommended;443;44.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This is so much fun, there are bugs but developers are working hard providing frequent updates but the bugs I've encountered are barely a problem, fixed by a quick reload, unlike other games released as early access and basically have support dropped the next day.Only negative Id say is when I create a world and invite friends to play with me I have to be online and playing or they cant continue.Public servers are unsurprisingly overloaded but if you can get on and play a bit then you probably wont get your friends on the same server, plus in order to continue your progress another time you need to get back to the same server, which even if you can remember which one it was (game doesnt tell you) its probably overloaded so you need to start again, theres no queues, just sorry server is full.There is somehow an option for creating private servers, but, my PC still needs to remain on even when Im not here and my PC is in dire need of an upgrade and probably wont handle that and playing at the same time, and I havnt put the effort in to trying as every start gives a strong warning about how buggy private servers are.Seems like a long complaint but besides that I really am enjoying this a lot still after 73 hours and look forward to seeing where it goes.Allowing comments as its entirely possibly my server problems are user error and would love an easy solution XD;Recommended;1128;95.0;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Monster Collecting + Base Building + Crafting + Survival + 3rd Person ShooterThis should be how this game is described as, not 'Pokemon with Guns'. This game plays nothing like Pokemon, and really the similarities end with the monster collecting. (Let's overlook the design similarities as that's a whole other argument...) You run around the world whacking away at pals and environment alike to get resources together to build your base and raise your army of slav... i mean pals! You then have your pals do the mundane chores around your base like gathering, cooking, item creation, etc. As you level up and unlock new technologies, you will grow out your base in not only size and function, but also aesthetic looks. But do be careful, for one of the several npc factions might decide to raid your base for funzies. So after you've set up and defended your base, you can finally step back out into the world to find more pals to enslav.. befriend and uncover dungeons to explore and conquer. All this prepares you for the boss tower fights, which is essentially the current end game 'raid' fights.There's so much more to get into or go over that this review could go on and on. As this is in early access, there are a lot of things that need polishing. I hope the story is expanded upon, maybe see some more cool cut scenes, and the developers holding up their timeline for updates. This game is diamond in the rough that has already captivated millions of players, just imagine what it'll do once it is fully polished.;Recommended;1253;98.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The initial 50 hours of gameplay offer an engaging experience, but beyond level 40, the game's pace diminishes, revealing its core focus on resource gathering and survival akin to games like ARK. If playing solo, customization of game settings is advisable for those interested in creature collection, automation, and building, as opposed to intensive grinding, you can customize everything about the games difficulty. (EXP Rates, Capture Rates, Resource Gathering Multipliers, etc...).There are two personal concerns I have with the game, along with a potential third issue that may be pertinent to many players:1.Despite the visually stunning landscapes and diverse biomes, the game world is empty, the game leaves desire for a more immersive and dynamic environment, this issue of the game extends to the issue number 2.2.Interaction within the game is confined to combat and resource farming. The absence of varied challenges or dangers in the solo or co-op modes can make the world seem static. The reliance on interactions with other players in multiplayer settings can lead to a sense of emptiness in solo or co-op play.3. **Resource heavy progression:**it's important to note that while the game offers a captivating creature collection aspect, its primary focus lies in resource gathering and automation. Decision-making revolves around base building and AUTOMATION, with less emphasis on creature collection, survival or exploration. Crafting superior weapons and Spheres (equivalent to Pokeballs, you cannot catch rare PALS without superior spheres) requires a strong focus on base construction and automation. You automate your tasks with your Pals they contribute to various tasks with minimal upkeep. Progression hinges on effectively using Pals for automation, each possessing unique skills and traits, with rarer Pals excelling in efficiency and speed, this is the main purpose of creature collection.Despite these concerns, the game remains a remarkable Early Access release filled with diverse content, including building, gathering, crafting, dungeons, farming, survival, automation, and creature collection!;Recommended;1814;58.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"9/10 game all around.There are very specific, nitpicking complaints I have about the game that I'm sure might change over time. Firstly, the general building of structures is not the most intuitive. Yes, you start with foundations but there's limits to where they can be placed and what qualifies as ""on the ground."" The expansion of your base will be ever growing, there's never enough Pals on base to do everything. You can get close to an automated supply chain but it's not fully automated.Overall game and performance? 10/10, very few issues to speak of aside from occasionally spawning in underground. Not the worst though because you can respawn via menu and go to your loot even though it's ""below ground"" and retrieve it. The pathing for the AI on the Pals definitely needs some tuning, they don't maneuver around the base territory as they should and that's for certain.Design and appearance? All I can say is all art is born from inspiration. Be that as it may, there are some very familiar looking Pals. This does not bother me on the consumer level as I've had nothing but a blast the entire 91 hours I've played. Only level 41 out of 50 levels in 91 hours but I've enjoyed every minute of it.";Recommended;993;98.2;

Firstly, the general building of structures is not the most intuitive. Yes, you start with foundations but there's limits to where they can be placed and what qualifies as ""on the ground."" The expansion of your base will be ever growing, there's never enough Pals on base to do everything. You can get close to an automated supply chain but it's not fully automated.Overall game and performance? 10/10, very few issues to speak of aside from occasionally spawning in underground. Not the worst though because you can respawn via menu and go to your loot even though it's ""below ground"" and retrieve it. The pathing for the AI on the Pals definitely needs some tuning, they don't maneuver around the base territory as they should and that's for certain.Design and appearance? All I can say is all art is born from inspiration. Be that as it may, there are some very familiar looking Pals. This does not bother me on the consumer level as I've had nothing but a blast the entire 91 hours I've played. Only level 41 out of 50 levels in 91 hours but I've enjoyed every minute of it.";Recommended;993;98.2;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"So much fun. Don't listen to the haters. Play it for two hours with a friend and then refund it if you don't like it...but I have a feeling if you give it two hours of your time you'll see it's worth it for early access. The devs have already shown that they are well connected to the pulse of their game and communicative with their community. They've already shown that they are going to diligently maintain and support this game, from what I've seen at least.What's really good about this game? It quite literally takes the concept of monster hunter/collector game and the concept of a survival crafting game and mashes them together into one gloriously entertaining package. The graphics are vibrant and crisp. The soundtrack is epic, yet unobtrusive. The controls are intuitive without feeling like the game is holding your hand. The XP rate, Pal spawn density, day/night speeds, and many more settings can be tweaked to your liking to create your own customized experience - or just select a preset difficulty mode. I for one have always hated the ""drop your ♥♥♥♥♥ when you bite it"" rule...well you can turn that one off and then play the rest just the normal way if that's what you like. Or you can turn all the damage all the way up, turn up all the spawn density, and XP rates, and then see how long you can last in a world of chaos and carnage. All I'm saying is this game is what you make of it and what you put into it - play it how you want. It's such a freeing experience.These types of base-building/survival crafting games usually have a steep learning curve as far as the tech tree and recipes/crafting goes - but this one's system just seems natural. The tech points earn regularly and naturally, without feeling like you have to do too much to grind them out. These games are also usually better with friends and this one is no different. But while it is definitely fun to play with a huge guild of pals and in-game PALS too, this game is actually so much fun with just you and one buddy. That's how I've been going at it so far and it's been very rewarding. And the difference between just playing solo and playing with just one other person is like night and day. There's an extra human brain running the game with you, but there's not too much conflicting input...not too many people to share loot with - but the challenges so far haven't been anything me and my friend couldn't handle.But hey, I'm just some random schmuck on the internet. Make your own decision.";Recommended;2034;13.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Deserves the attention. Especially if you like cute lil guys;Recommended;51;29.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Better than Pokemon.;Recommended;18;43.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I'm coming at this from someone who has played nearly every Survival Crafting game out there. The vast majority are awful, unfinished, unpolished, and get abandoned - nearly all of them suffer one of those issues in all honesty. And let me tell you, there is some truly awful ones out there that you didn't even know existed. I do, to my misfortune. When it comes to Palworld - I've not seen a survival open world crafting game come into early access, right at the very beginning and be this solid since Grounded. I said the same thing after playing Grounded for the first time they allowed access - this game is going to be something special, and it is now, Palworld is going to be something special too. It's something special right at the very beginning of its life, right now.To list a few things that most games of the same genre hardly ever manage to get functioning. The building? Things snap together easily, no annoying system to do it. Resources refund when you deconstruct. The climbing? It actually works--looking at you Palia (not a survival game but their climbing is omega scuffed.) Optimization? High frame rates outside of some hitches here and there, though not consistent issues outside of random memory leak after a few hours that doesn't always occur. Aiming? Gunplay? Nothing groundbreaking but solid for an over the shoulder perspective.What about building? The content? Tell me about that. As for building there's a ton of items right now. -Most- of them work. I say most because tall cabinets currently don't seem to want to place atop floors. Besides that, it works well. Oh and sorting, there's signs to put in front of boxes, thank god. Content wise there's 50+ something levels, each one with its own technology tree. It does begin to boil down to a certain gameplay loop eventually but, that gameplay loop is catching... Pals - caught myself there. There is some grind although it's not an atrocious one, or a frustratingly tedious one. Did I mention there's invasions like in 7DTD? Not nearly to the extent as 7DTD, yet they are there. Normally they're quite insignificant, but I did have one moment where hell broke loose.But how do the Pals function? Their AI? There's still kinks to work out, however, as of now they function surprisingly well. Normally anything remotely like this absolutely does not work, or breaks with this many different systems. They do get stuck sometimes... and some of them are straight up out for carnage. My pig will throw down with anything it can see in the open world.As a tip without any spoilers. Don't place your crafting station inside a building with doors - even if they're open. Pals don't like doorways. Put them outside on the ground, or on a raised platform surrounded by stairs. They will very much reenact the famous, ""HOLD THE DOOR!"" Sometimes they'll go in, later once you have more in your base though they hardly ever will go in.There are bugs right now, the above paragraph explained one - most are in that nature, and are predictable. By predictable I mean once you figure out it's a bug, you can avoid it with a work around, instead of game halting progression and they're quite minor such as names not showing on the map after a fast travel or first load in multiplayer. Speaking of which, fast travelling again tends to fix whatever broke rather often.If you're a huge fan of Survival Crafting games, and have been chomping at the bit for something new, and solid but have been left starving, then Palworld is that new game. Even if you're not a fan of the ""theme"", *cough*. If you're a fan of Automation games... I'll say it's absolutely more of a Survival Crafting game rather than an automation game. There's quite a lot of automation, however it's not Satisfactory/Factorio level, not even close, yet it's still there. It fits nicely.I'm not someone who complains on Reddit, however I am quite critical of games. I've seen the greats, and I see cash grabs nearly non stop. Palworld is headed to be one of the greats so long as the developers keep up with what they're doing. Which, it seems they let go of their previous game once they imagined this one. I would have too. This is a golden ticket idea. Dwight came up with it.Also I'd like to add randomly... this game reminds me a lot more of Digimon World 1 for the PS1, you send you Digimon to station, they train--in Palworld they do work--then you go out and fight things. In all honesty, Digimon had mons with guns too. However, it's absolutely taking inspiration from the one everyone references. I get it, but I see the Digi a lot too.Palworld is worth the money.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"I'm coming at this from someone who has played nearly every Survival Crafting game out there. The vast majority are awful, unfinished, unpolished, and get abandoned - nearly all of them suffer one of those issues in all honesty. And let me tell you, there is some truly awful ones out there that you didn't even know existed. I do, to my misfortune. When it comes to Palworld - I've not seen a survival open world crafting game come into early access, right at the very beginning and be this solid since Grounded. I said the same thing after playing Grounded for the first time they allowed access - this game is going to be something special, and it is now, Palworld is going to be something special too. It's something special right at the very beginning of its life, right now.To list a few things that most games of the same genre hardly ever manage to get functioning. The building? Things snap together easily, no annoying system to do it. Resources refund when you deconstruct. The climbing? It actually works--looking at you Palia (not a survival game but their climbing is omega scuffed.) Optimization? High frame rates outside of some hitches here and there, though not consistent issues outside of random memory leak after a few hours that doesn't always occur. Aiming? Gunplay? Nothing groundbreaking but solid for an over the shoulder perspective.What about building? The content? Tell me about that. As for building there's a ton of items right now. -Most- of them work. I say most because tall cabinets currently don't seem to want to place atop floors. Besides that, it works well. Oh and sorting, there's signs to put in front of boxes, thank god. Content wise there's 50+ something levels, each one with its own technology tree. It does begin to boil down to a certain gameplay loop eventually but, that gameplay loop is catching... Pals - caught myself there. There is some grind although it's not an atrocious one, or a frustratingly tedious one. Did I mention there's invasions like in 7DTD? Not nearly to the extent as 7DTD, yet they are there. Normally they're quite insignificant, but I did have one moment where hell broke loose.But how do the Pals function? Their AI? There's still kinks to work out, however, as of now they function surprisingly well. Normally anything remotely like this absolutely does not work, or breaks with this many different systems. They do get stuck sometimes... and some of them are straight up out for carnage. My pig will throw down with anything it can see in the open world.As a tip without any spoilers. Don't place your crafting station inside a building with doors - even if they're open. Pals don't like doorways. Put them outside on the ground, or on a raised platform surrounded by stairs. They will very much reenact the famous, ""HOLD THE DOOR!"" Sometimes they'll go in, later once you have more in your base though they hardly ever will go in.There are bugs right now, the above paragraph explained one - most are in that nature, and are predictable. By predictable I mean once you figure out it's a bug, you can avoid it with a work around, instead of game halting progression and they're quite minor such as names not showing on the map after a fast travel or first load in multiplayer. Speaking of which, fast travelling again tends to fix whatever broke rather often.If you're a huge fan of Survival Crafting games, and have been chomping at the bit for something new, and solid but have been left starving, then Palworld is that new game. Even if you're not a fan of the ""theme"", *cough*. If you're a fan of Automation games... I'll say it's absolutely more of a Survival Crafting game rather than an automation game. There's quite a lot of automation, however it's not Satisfactory/Factorio level, not even close, yet it's still there.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"8\10 Amazing game for being incomplete.-Game does have some bugs, you can't transfer characters between worlds, servers have been on and off for the past week, and the story seems non-existent so if you're looking for a complete game I'd give it some time.-The game other wise is extremely fun to play. You can set up your own settings for each world so if you like to suffer with some time consuming grind you can do just that but same goes for making it extremely relaxed and speedy. The pals assisting your resource collection is your bases are extremely helpful. Combat can be difficult and the occasional bug can be frustrating but also can be used to your advantage. Controls on keyboard have been simple and easy to use but I did have a problem with the ""Q"" key being the default for throwing your sphere's. So many spheres wasted in the beginning trying to maneuver and accidentally throwing a sphere.-My honest opinion given only 50 hours of playtime I'd give the game a 8\10. I'm sure once this game is fully released it will be close to a 10\10";Recommended;866;53.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"8\10 Amazing game for being incomplete.-Game does have some bugs, you can't transfer characters between worlds, servers have been on and off for the past week, and the story seems non-existent so if you're looking for a complete game I'd give it some time.-The game other wise is extremely fun to play. You can set up your own settings for each world so if you like to suffer with some time consuming grind you can do just that but same goes for making it extremely relaxed and speedy. The pals assisting your resource collection is your bases are extremely helpful. Combat can be difficult and the occasional bug can be frustrating but also can be used to your advantage. Controls on keyboard have been simple and easy to use but I did have a problem with the ""Q"" key being the default for throwing your sphere's. So many spheres wasted in the beginning trying to maneuver and accidentally throwing a sphere.-My honest opinion given only 50 hours of playtime I'd give the game a 8\10. I'm sure once this game is fully released it will be close to a 10\10";Recommended;866;53.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Better than Nintendo :)And half the price!Based on how often the developer updated and worked on Craftopia I cannot wait to see how far they take Palworld!;Recommended;129;60.6;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;am pleasantly surprised with this game, even in its obvious rough stage (at least on the XBox X, I cannot talk about the PC version). And I am a hardcore Pokémon fan who shiny hunts almost daily and I am still working on my living Shiny Dex. And I have bought every main line Pokémon game for Switch on launch day (something I usually don't do, except perhaps for recent Zelda and MK games). So, yes, even hardcore Pokéfans can enjoy this game imo.I consider this game to be very fun and addicting, and it is very promising considering that eventhough it is in early access / beta stage, there are few things to complain about, and it runs decently well. The gameplay is fun and easy to get into, it has a huge map that reminds me of Tears of the Kingdom or Genshin Impact, and a base / home building feature that I can't help but compare with Fortnite or Fallout 76.It does have some glitches and I even encountered a HUGE hole in the map near the icy area (nearby a ginormous tree) that lead to nowhere and I had to kill myself to get out of. The music and sound can use some work, and in places the textures are rough as heck.If you are a gamer that enjoys exploring a big open world, collecting cute creepers, building your base like a giant castle, survival games, or even blasting everything with guns or bazookas on top of a giant creature, I do recommend this game. And right now is dirty cheap;Recommended;1138;26.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;The best game i have ever played in a while!!! Its just an easy buy. So you start out in this game no clue about what to do or where to go but you follow the tutorial and slowly begin to progress you make a palbox make get some pals level up then boom youre walking around and find a boss and your first reaction will always be uh oh i gotta get out of here but maybe youve progressed a little you try to fight the boss and you win boom you feel on top of the world then you go to the technology tree look for if you can get something with it there is a cool little saddle or sum you can ride it with so you focus on leveling up just working toward that saddle all the while your having fun with each and every thing you discover something follows it up you find a new pal then you work towards killing or capturing it then you work towards the ability then you run around with it use it when your in fight then find a new pal and repeat and although it sounds as if it would get boring every pal is so different so you never feel as if youre just repeating the process and you just play the game find something new then progress and there is always something new the map is so big and when you see some of the islands you think no way i can go to that then you swim over and have tons of new pals to discover then you conquer the new area then move on youre always unlocking something to work towards and working towards it is fun there is never a deficit of things to do and you feel as if you always have something to do!!!!!!! My #1 Favorite game buy it as soon as possible!!!! (i would also like to add, some people say leveling up takes way too long IT DOES NOT youre just not progressing right there is never a time where you feel you are waiting years for a level unless youre doing the wrong thing maybe youre in the wrong area or sum but when one thing doesnt work try something else dont just fight the same boss over and over) and remember it is an open world sandbox-like game you arent forced to go capture a boss do whatever you want use a drgon fruit on a gumoss or sum have fun quit playing so linear gosh uhh i love this game so much i would do anything to see it prosper!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;Recommended;1767;87.1;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Pokemon could never.On a serious note. I love this game so far. If you like Pokemon and Minecraft (or any survival games) I would recommend trying this game out. Now this game does have its issues right now due to it being early access. Some of these things are the pals ai paths, pals somehow getting stuck out of base, and pals getting stuck in general. All of these are to be expected as they are currently still updating the game. Overall i have fun and enjoy playing the game. Its what we've always wanted from Pokemon.;Recommended;428;27.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Took me 80 hours to catch all pals and defeat all bosses in the game. I would say this game is an absolute steal for its price. If you like grindy games like Ark or atlas, you will love this game. It is a little slow at first, but picks up quickly until the mid game. Leveling from 40-50 was extremely painful and grindy. Overall I look forward to farming more pals to get gods rolls in preparation for future content.;Recommended;338;91.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;it would be even better if the world settings become permanent when the world is created. The ability to modify the worlds settings such as exp and damage multiplier etc. while we are in the mid game slightly ruins the game balance.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;If you want to, your base to be destroyed and your pals stolen after dozens of hours of play. I recommend you to play on the official server.;Recommended;114;87.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"This game is basically if Pokemon and ARK had a child. It's very much ARK but 100x better with the bonus of these pals to either enslave or help your exploration and duties with in a meaningful way. Anybody who has played the former will instantly recognise the very same mechanics this game employs albeit with its own spin.Having played ARK Survival Evolved before, I can say this game feels at home for me having known the way things work from unlocking items to the base building and world exploration. The grind here is definitely less severe, and especially in the field of base building are things much more simplified and enjoyable. Building bases is actually fun rather than time consuming like it was in the former, and of course I cannot forget the lil Pals that help you with such, definitely making the game less lonely in the context of playing this game singleplayer. Speaking of which, the game enjoys thousands and thousands of players to play with. So you can always hop on an active multiplayer server if that's your thing.Some people criticise this game for its likeness and similarity to Pokemon — which I can see why — but I think copying or having something else as a source of inspiration isn't necessarily a bad thing, coming from a Pokemon fan myself. In this instance, fusing the monster collecting game with the open world survival exploration and mechanics of ARK, you get something special; something enjoyable and to an extent novel more so on the PC game market.I'm happy to have come across and bought this, and I'm looking forward to future updates especially with this game being in Early Access. More islands, more Pals, quality of life fixes and changes, more fun!All I can hope for is the devs to take care of this game and not let it degrade to the performance and bug nightmare that is ARK. I always thought if I should've picked up ARK again after refunding it over severe issues years ago, but buying this game instead for a similar if not better experience is more than worth it.";Recommended;1665;21.5;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;wow!!;Recommended;5;92.7;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;DAMN GOOD;Recommended;8;26.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"TL;DR: Palworld gets a whole lot right, even if it falls down in some ways. It's not hampered by the relatively minor glitches, and whether or not it's similarity to other games is a deal breaker is up to you.Overall, the experience of crafting and building up your base while catching ""pals"" to gradually automate tasks and have them aid you in battle is super compelling and fun. The world design is surprisingly interesting and vast, with lots to explore and discover. The third person camera view is just right to feel immersed but also get to see your character model, which for me is exactly what I like. The implementation of guns is surprisingly fun, despite all the guns I've unlocked so far being quite slow single-shot ones. It just doesn't matter that they're slow because using your Pals to do a lot of the fighting, whether it's mounted on the back of one or fighting side by side, is really where the fun is. The leveling of the pals by area is just right, so if you go exploring off into a place that has level 30 pals and you're only level 20, you know that it's probably best to come back to that area later. But if you really want to you can go anywhere you can see. Also, there's always some new pal or boss to fight or catch, which then makes me go back to craft better gear, train up stronger pals, fight the new enemy, and rinse and repeat. It's really fun.So far, bugs, glitches, and crashes have been few and far between fortunately. But there are a few that persist even after the latest patch released just yesterday (Feb 2nd), mainly to do with pal behavior. For example, Pals will do any tasks they are suited to do automatically, or you can pick them up and throw them at the specific task you want them to focus on. Sometimes no matter what you do, you just can't make certain pals do a task for unknown reasons. They aren't hungry, they have full sanity, but they won't do it. I still have this problem even after the patch that supposedly fixed it. But it's not game breaking because a different pal will eventually do the task, it just might take a little longer than it could have.Of course the elephant in the room is the similarity to Pokemon. Just to be clear, the game itself is nothing like any Pokemon game to date. In fact, in many ways Palworld is actually frustrating, because it just shows how little effort has been put into the Pokemon games in the past years. This game feels like what Pokemon could have been, or at least an example of some potential innovations that would have improved the Pokemon games massively. What IS similar is some (but not all) of the creature designs. If that worries you, there are lots of youtube videos comparing some of them. Whether or not it's a problem legally is yet to be seen. I personally bought the game before seeing just how similar some of them are, so I'll continue playing. Whether or not it's a deal breaker is up to you.But in the end, the creature design isn't what makes this game as good as it is. It's the way it seamlessly integrates multiple game mechanics and genres in a way that makes it greater than the sum of its parts. Mechanics that make it feel like a modern game that isn't held back by old school game design. Sure, they didn't innovate any of these mechanics, but they implement them well. For example, you can sprint and then slide downhill like a lot of shooters do, which makes running around the huge open world that much faster. You can climb on any surface as long as you have stamina left, and use a glider, just like BOTW, and I'm glad. Why shouldn't an open world game allow you to climb on anything and get down safely? The capturing of pals in balls after getting their health down as low as possible is really well implemented, arguably even better than in pokemon games. The usage of pals to automate crafting and base building is snappy and easy, like a less tedious version of Ark. So did Palworld invent these mechanics? No. Does it do them well? Definitely. When modern games don't incorporate recently innovated mechanics, they feel old, sluggish, and outdated. That isn't even to mention the fact that ALL games incorporate and build upon mechanics innovated by other games, as does all art for that matter. But in the end, if all you see is a ""pokemon clone"" or a ""BOTW clone"", then I guess don't get it, but I disagree. You'll be missing out on a fun survival game with some very well-implemented mechanics, though.The game definitely isn't perfect though. I'm 20 hours in and the game feels like there's pretty much no story. Sure there are some journal entries you find around the world, but even as a person who plays games for story, I haven't read most of them. They just aren't that interesting. The world itself is interesting physically, and the pals interact with each other in a way that leads to cool moments of emergent game play. But the human NPCs may as well just be pals. There's a settlement you discover early on, but it doesn't feel like a place humans live in, it feels like a base another player made and then abandoned. The NPCs have no routine or real function other than a couple vendors. But that doesn't stop the game from being compelling, in the same way minecraft is a game people play for hundreds of hours, because the slow drip feed of new things to craft, new pals to catch, and new bosses to fight is really good.";Recommended;4396;22.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;What Pokemon Arceus should've been;Recommended;30;65.4;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld, developed by Pocketpair, is a game that manages to polarise its players like few others. It's a title that blends elements from various gaming genres into a unique concoction, and whether you'll love or loathe it largely depends on your expectations and preferences.Palworld boasts a colorful and vibrant art style that perfectly complements its whimsical setting. The Pals themselves are beautifully designed, each with its own personality and traits. One of the standout features of Palworld is the way it lets players interact with their Pals. These charming creatures are not just for show but play an integral role in the game. You can capture, raise, train, and even arm your Pals with various tools and weapons, adding a unique twist to the traditional creature collection formula.The open-world aspect of Palworld offers a sense of freedom and adventure. While it may not be as vast as some other open-world games, it still provides enough space for exploration, resource gathering, and encountering various challenges. Palworld shines in its multiplayer mode. Co-op gameplay allows you to team up with friends to explore the world, share resources, and engage in exciting challenges. Building and customizing your base alongside your pals is an incredibly enjoyable cooperative experience.Despite the litany of ‘Pokémon with guns!’ comparisons swarming the internet, Palworld actually has far more in common with survival games. Borrowing the best bits of Valheim and Ark: Survival Evolved, Japanese developer Pocketpair builds upon that craft-happy formula and sprinkles some creature-catching comforts atop. Everything that Palworld lacks in originality, it makes up for with impressive execution. The combination of survival genre elements with creature catching is hugely captivating, resulting in a serotonin-gobbling gameplay loop.8.5/10;Recommended;1584;20.2;

The fact that they've had decades to do it and still haven't goes to show how out of touch they are with what the fans want. It's early access and it's already IMO game of the year and it's only up from herePeople hate what's popular, but don't be that guy. Put your hipster ego to the side and jump on the bandwagon because this game is the real deal;Recommended;503;67.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Allow me to share my thoughts on this intriguing game, which, while enjoyable at first glance, reveals its limitations once the initial enchantment begins to fade.While I do indeed recommend this title for its initial fun factor, I must confess that the allure wanes rather quickly. Despite its promises of open-world exploration, survival challenges, and creature collecting, the reality is a tad lackluster. The world feels somewhat barren, with a dearth of meaningful activities to engage in.Sure, there are plenty of companions to encounter, but alas, they all blend together after a while, lacking the distinctiveness and charm one would hope for. It's as if they're merely variations on a theme, with little to distinguish one from the other.In summary, this game falls squarely into the realm of mediocrity. While it can offer moments of amusement, it ultimately fails to deliver on its potential. It's a decent enough diversion, but don't expect it to hold your attention for long once the initial novelty wears off.I would definitely keep my eye on this one for future developments.;Recommended;916;18.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is in EARLY ACCESS and has less jank then the majority of AAA releases, it also has FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT from the get go. I've been playing rust with a controller mapper for 11 years and there's still no controller support even though it's available on console. (I can't use a mouse and keyboard) and as a person that loves to buy early access open world survival crafting games that never have controller support I can't express how much joy this brings me. along side that the game is just brilliant, can not fault it or the amazing dev team in the slightest.;Recommended;470;77.2;

No cheaters, no fighting over resources, just clean catching and fighting.Once progress is made and they add more content, it will just put the nail in the coffin to show Nintendo what Pokemon fans TRULY want.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Fun game, definitely heavily leans into the survival game aspect so if you're not a fan of that don't buy it. However if you do like survival games this is definitely a worthwhile purchase. Performance wise you do need a decent PC but anything built after 2020 with a dedicated graphics card should be fine, otherwise check to see if you meet the minimum specs. I'm running it on a i5 9600k, Gtx 1660ti, and 16 GB 3200mhz DDR4 ram on custom settings between low-medium at 1080p, and getting 40-60 fps with occasional-but not frequent enough to be annoying-lag.;Recommended;462;7.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;An amazingly fun game that combines elements of creature collection games (with a clear Pokemon influence) and survival games (clearly inspired by Ark). I highly recommend it.;Recommended;149;60.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Bro this game is so fun, you get to go out and explore this massive map. it has multiple biomes where you can catch different kinds of pals. my personal favorite is the relaxasourus because of how durpy it looks :);Recommended;174;66.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;I really dont get all the hype of this game. It just feels like an ARK clone with elements of breath of the wild, and pokemon look alikes. I was skepical but gave it a shot.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Great ideas, fun mechanics, doesn't require the wiki on a second screen, a little janky but easily forgivable for the fun idea / foundation of the present game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's the P*kemon you've always wanted. Base building. RPG (both your Pals and yourself). Open world exploration. FPS. Super great game with a well balanced combination of resource gathering, exploration, and leveling. There are many quality of life mechanics in this game that make it very easy to play (any resources stored in any storage in your base is usable at any crafting table, pals can automate almost everything, etc) and judging by the recent updates, the developers actually listen to feedback from users to further improve gameplay. 10/10, this game brought back everybody from our college friend group to play on the same server for the first time in 10 years!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Terrible. Just terrible.This is about the most buggy a mainstream game can get. This game should have been free-to-play until they fixed their core issues with the main issue being frequent server crashes. The public servers have been running for about 10 days and early this morning a patch wiped nearly EVERYONE'S entire character and base progress, tanking 10 real days of game time for no good reason.Unless this game turns FTP, if you intend on playing with friends or on a public server DON'T PURCHASE THIS, as it is so unreliable that you will likely lose your progress too.Instant uninstall, and will be requesting a refund, along with advising everyone I know about this game against it.;Not Recommended;579;31.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Legitimately a more stable release than most Early Access games made by AAA studios. Runs just fine on hardware I got in 2018.Actually a good game, little in the way of plot, but tbh I don't mind that.Basebuilding is actually not a chore, save relocation, but that's typical of most survival games.The Fast Travel system could be tweaked a bit, having to be at a FT point to travel to a different one or your base is a bit annoying.;Recommended;353;15.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;the game has a big problem with hackers and some bugs, if you build a base at the start of where you spawn a hacker will destroy it unless they cant find it.. had a hacker delete my Palbox and lost a lot of monsters, but the reason I give this game a good review, even the hackers can't ruin the game for what its leading to be, base building, pet monsters, so much to explore.. I hated the game at first but I see where it can lead! this game is fun and goofy at time, wish they would add voice proximity chat in a future update.;Recommended;423;56.0;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Was it worth the $30? MaybeDid I enjoy it? Yes, however its only worth one play through at most.I suspect majority of players will burn out after 3 weeks of play. And this will be a dead game.Yes, its an early access game that JUST came out. But facts are facts.Absolutely no end game play, little to no real substance of the core game. Other than wander around and catch new pals while you discover a landscaped filled with random chests and glowy green squirrels. Once that is over, there's nothing much else to do. So it gets boring real quick. Unless you are the completionist nature and you 'Want to catch them all' this game will quickly become boring for you.;Not Recommended;545;106.6;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;As of right now my rating for this game is low. I have 69 hour into a server, the moment I used medicine everything was lost. There is a memory leak in the code that is causing this. It's the second time.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Just Absolutely Amazing!;Recommended;22;28.8;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Best game of its kind;Recommended;17;79.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Despite it's early access status the game is pretty stable. I can tell that many aspects of it are not fully fledged, and some ideas were not tested properly, but overall this is one of the best early access games I've seen.The main reason I recommend the game is to its approach to game making. No microtransactions, no MTS shop, no currencies, no mobile BS, just a plain ""semi-complete"" game. It gives the players what they want. I almost forgot what that feels like. You want fast mounts? You got it. It zips through the map faster than my laptop can load it in. And it's not even the fastest thing. You want more than 1 companions? You got it. Several can appear next to you. You don't need to buy a new mount when you want one. You can just tame one or breed a crossbreed.My point is, this game was built with gameplay first. And with players first, not money first. And that's why it's a shining example of what games should be. That's the reason of its well deserved success.Currently the game lacks some things that would be normal for other survival games. Guilds are very basic and badly explained. Building pieces are missing critical parts like corner roofs and rails. There are plenty of bugs with Pal AIs, and their keeping was not tested well.. mid-game, especially lvl 25+ feels extremely empty. The lack of story is a great loss, and the small log entries are just text. it's 2024, Devs. Make it voiced!A short note on the breeding: It's one of the best concepts I've seen compared to ARK and NMS. I wish there would be more variation in outputs, but overall it's rather a play with skills - you breed useful skills and breed out useless or harming ones. Interesting. Better than ARK since it's not that random, and better than NMS since it's more complex.From what I've heard from the story that is a bit fuzzy and lacks overall drive. These are things the devs can pump out later I guess. Would be better if they would have finished the game more, but as I said earlier, it's still quite impressive and better early access than most games I've seen.It is highly recommended because it's a proper game, made for players by players, without corporate mandates or forced cut content, that is added later as DLC. and without microtransactions or itemshops or GDMF battlepasses. It's just a good, proper, fun game that allows the player to have fun. It creates fun, not tricking and manipulating you to pay 3 times. The game is about a GAME not a play of currencies and transactions and other BS. When you discuss the game you discuss your fun in the game. And that's how it should be, Every game should be like Palworld. Just concentrate on player fun.Well done, folks. Keep the updates coming!";Recommended;2222;206.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Highly recommending just because I've put 40 hours+ into this game between steam and game pass and I've had a blast. The new update today is causing some serious problems for me though. I'm having a hard time getting it to launch, and when it does I'm experiencing an insane amount of input lag on single player mode, and when I go throw my palspheres the text on screen is showing up in different langauges?Playing at optimal settings with a Ryzen 5800 and 3060ti GPU. They're updating this game so quickly I'm sure these issues will get resolved.;Recommended;451;5.3;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Be warned, Palworld is severely addictive and you can lose track of time playing. I thought this game looked stupid, but gave it a shot based on friends' recommendations, and it is extremely fun. There are definitely some bugs, but it isn't in full release mode and new patches roll out everyday. The gameplay is fun and you can do almost anything you want in the game, and being able to work collaboratively with friends is a great time;Recommended;359;34.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Yes, amazing game only had it for about three days and played for 15 hours in total so far, can't wait to see what they do when they do updates for the game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"If you liked the open and free-roaming exploration in BotW, try this game.If you liked Ark: Survival Evolved's variety and player freedom, try this game.If you have ever played Pixelmon, try the game.Most of the complaints I've seen towards this game have to do with the laggy/inconsistent official servers and the game being buggy, which are both to be expected for an early access game like this. You should know by now that Unreal Engine games are extremely fun to find exploits and bugs in; and honestly, you're doing the devs a favor if you are. (assuming that you are reporting them)I've experienced a single crash while using the in-game menus, and all of the bugs I've experienced are either minor enough to just be laughed at for their silliness, or give the player a completely optional way of exploiting the game. (like using mount-able pals to clip through walls, vertically teleport, or launch yourself really fast)If you are only looking for a fun Pokemon alternative that has already proven to be better received than any mainline Pokemon release since the 2000's, stop right now before you get spoiled and buy the game. Play it for an hour and a half, then refund it if you don't like it. This game shows incredible potential and goes far and beyond when it comes to putting twists on the genres it holds.";Recommended;1092;41.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game has ruined my life. It's been around 6 days of playing this game at the time of posting this review and I have not slept. My wife left me and took the kids, the car, the furniture, everything... gone... I can't stop... Someone please help me!10/10 will play again when my first session ends.;Recommended;246;182.2;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"If you liked the open and free-roaming exploration in BotW, try this game.If you liked Ark: Survival Evolved's variety and player freedom, try this game.If you have ever played Pixelmon, try the game.Most of the complaints I've seen towards this game have to do with the laggy/inconsistent official servers and the game being buggy, which are both to be expected for an early access game like this. You should know by now that Unreal Engine games are extremely fun to find exploits and bugs in; and honestly, you're doing the devs a favor if you are. (assuming that you are reporting them)I've experienced a single crash while using the in-game menus, and all of the bugs I've experienced are either minor enough to just be laughed at for their silliness, or give the player a completely optional way of exploiting the game. (like using mount-able pals to clip through walls, vertically teleport, or launch yourself really fast)If you are only looking for a fun Pokemon alternative that has already proven to be better received than any mainline Pokemon release since the 2000's, stop right now before you get spoiled and buy the game. Play it for an hour and a half, then refund it if you don't like it. This game shows incredible potential and goes far and beyond when it comes to putting twists on the genres it holds.";Recommended;1092;41.8;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;It's awesome! Get it!;Recommended;18;49.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Palworld is a game that combines monster catching, base building and adventuring in a unique and captivating way. The developers have created a rich and diverse world full of adorable and dangerous creatures called Pals, which you can tame, train, craft with, and even use as weapons. Palworld offers a lot of freedom and creativity for players who want to explore, survive, and fight in this wild and unpredictable land.The game is still in early access, but it already has a lot of content and features to enjoy. You can build your own base from scratch, using various materials and structures, and customize it to your liking. You can also recruit Pals to work for you, or treat them as your loyal companions, or you know enslave them too if that’s your thing. You can craft different items and equipment, such as guns, armor, vehicles, and more. You can also join forces with other players online, and cooperate or compete with them in various modes and activities.Palworld is not a game for the faint of heart, though. It has a dark and twisted sense of humor, and it does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of life in this world. You will encounter hostile humans and Pals, who will try to kill you or steal your resources. You will also face moral dilemmas, such as whether to exploit your Pals for your own benefit, or to respect and protect them. You will also witness some shocking and hilarious scenes, such as Pals being used as shields, meat, or cannon fodder.Palworld is a game that will make you laugh, cry, and gasp in awe. It is a game that will challenge your skills, your creativity, and your ethics. It is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, and make you eager to see what the developers have in store for the future. Palworld is a game that you should not miss, if you are looking for a fresh and original take on the monster catching genre.;Recommended;1543;53.4;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"So, I've heard really lots of stuff about this game, some of them were really positive, and some others really negative. Some people, including my self, said that this game could even be a possible goty, and some other people said that it was just an ""ark mod with pokemon in it"". But let's start from the beginning: This game was developed by Pocketpair, an indie japanese company administrated by Takuro Mizobe, known for Craftopia, and now for Palworld. To be honest, I kinda understand why some people say it's like Ark with a pokemon mod, basically because the models are just so, SO SIMILAR to Pokemon, and the survival part is Ark, purely ark, BUT the difference is in combat that is more ""action"" than ark, everything is less buggy than ark, even if it is an early access, and it's more fun than pokemon, starting from x and y. I highly recommend this game if you like survival, the open world kinda works-ish, I just don't like the map, too many islands kinda limitating the exploration, and for some stuff is just really unbalanced, all the bosses are at least level 11, leveling is way too slow, and you can get some overpowered pals thanks to the syndicate gunners that somewhere in the map, they capture some random pals. 7.5/10";Recommended;1020;28.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Game is super fun. It's everything that pokemon needed to make it fun for me. Building, guns, automation.It is definitely early access. There's some major bugs in the game, mostly visible by the time you hit end game.multiplayer is a laggy mess. and my main gripe... the percent chance to catch is massively bugged. Xcom levels of hilarity failing a 90% chance 20 times in a row. I have a feeling there's something coded in there if there's lag it just lets the pal out... unless the % shown is just an outright lie.that aside, having a ton of fun with the occasional wanna throw controller.;Recommended;486;91.7;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;This game is extremely fun, but I feel it's important to call out some gripes I have that do need addressing.Ranking up Pals' abilities requires increasing numbers of them, going from 4, to 16, to 32, to 64. However, unless you're focusing solely on one type of Pal from very early on, you're going to struggle with finding space for them in your Pal box. Right now, you only get 480 slots, and there's more than a hundred varieties of Pal.The Pals' AI is pretty damn buggy. You'll find your base Pals getting stuck on your roof, inside of walls, or just forgetting how to move until they're starving and injured, requiring expensive medicine to get them back in top shape.Base assignments are still pretty rough, and there's no way to assign a Pal to a specific bed yet. They at least added some changes to make it easier to assign Pals to specific tasks, but with the quality of the AI, it's a mixed bag.Ideally there should be some better ways to transport goods long range. If you want to move bases, be prepared for a long, arduous process of moving things one by one. It'd be great to be able to ship items via Pals.Overall, I think this game has a strong foundation, but still has a way to go before I'd recommend it without reservation, but it's an excellent blend of games, and gave us something that Game Freak just hasn't been able to do with Pokémon. I hope they continue to work on this, build it out more and more, and give us even more content.;Recommended;1190;59.5;

The game-play itself is very fun, the exploration, base building, pal hunting has me hooked. the only negative thing I can say is the character creator is very bare-bones.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Pokemon and ARK: Survival Evolved merge to create something adorable and horrible. I did not want this game, nor did I want to like this game, but despite this I find myself exceedingly impatient for both the Xbox Game Pass version to catch up, and my friend(s) to be available for Steam play.Skip to the final set of lines at the bottom if you only want to know who I'd recommend this game to. I struggle with reducing word count.The game starts off by throwing your nearly-naked character into the most beginner-friendly zone of the map, but you're welcome to choose alternative spawn locations upon death. The tutorial is objective-based and features no flow-breaking popups like most modern games that apparently need to explain that WASD is movement and Shift makes you move faster. The tutorial also baits you into thinking you need to set up a base in the first five seconds, but I'd suggest adventuring long enough to find at least two fast-travel points before deciding on a place to set your first anchor, as you are prevented from building further bases until you make a decent amount of progress, or demolish your existing one. Base hubs also function as fast-travel points so there's no fear of needing to parkour up a cliff every time you want to go a home on a plateau.Some good things:The map features a step-up style level distribution where the further from a spawn location you are, the more dangerous the foes or environment, so there's little fear of being jumped by a level 40 something in a level 3 area.The map features a lot of pathed terrain leading to large clearings perfect for building bases, yet you are not limited to only making bases in these clearings if you so choose.Pals assigned to bases do tasks automatically, to the point that most manual interactions you might need to do involve queueing crafts or wrangling stray Pals falling into water they can't climb out of.Even though wild Pals are officially dead when defeated, captured pals are only rendered incapacitated and can be revived by placing them in a Palbox (base hub) for 10 minutes.The player can climb on virtually any surface as long as they have sufficient stamina. As long as you have a wall, there's no reason to fear falling while building at your base(s).Pals range on average from cutesy and cuddly to fierce and pointy, but everything features some degree of roundness that makes even spiky lads a little more cute. There's something for everyone's tastes, regardless.Bosses don't seem to be one-offs and can thus be farmed for special materials or captured, although ancient tech points are only granted the first time each player defeats a given boss.Some bad things:Menus can prove unresponsive to certain commands at times. You can use TAB to navigate out of most menus... sometimes. Other times you have to first mentally process that TAB isn't working and move up to Escape.You cannot reposition the Palbox (base hub) freely. Rather, it must be dis- and re-assembled, and often the requirements for placement differ from the restrictions on building near it. You might find that if you try to place a Palbox in exactly the same spot, after building structures around it, that the location is not valid for placement and have to tear down a larger amount of your structure than expected.Bonuses to capture chance do not seem to calculate while aiming a Sphere, but only when an attempt is made. 10% might turn into 25%+ but you'd never know until you throw.Bodies of water restrict building in ways that terrain itself doesn't. You can build a staircase that clips 90% through the ground but not 0.5% into a body of water... usually.There is a slide mechanic that cannot be steered, even if the physics of sliding would dictate a shift in trajectory. Your slide will go in a straight line no matter how curvaceous the terrain is, until you level out or start to go upward where the slide stops. It is very fast, though.It seems that there is a soft time limit of around 60-120 minutes for multiplayer before the server and connection both may become unstable, causing even the host to stutter or skip around. This problem does not occur in single player. Everyone restarting the game usually alleviates most or all of the issue until it starts again.I'll reserve applying a numerical rating until more development is done. It would be unfair to apply a general lasting expectation with a number so soon into early access. However, I will say I would currently recommend this to anyone looking for a new survival-sandbox experience with Pokemon themes and more mature themes in background lore. And guns. But also maybe play with friends, though consider whether or not to play ""together"" or simply ""alongside"" as the base limit is shared if you're in a group (Guild).Review subject to change as I play more and as updates are pushed through. Review also limited in scope due to rambling and Steam text limits. One should always read more than one review to get a more complete picture anyway, yeah?";Recommended;4151;54.9;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;"Fun time, midpoint needs a LOOOT of work. One example, I can staff my base with all water types after an attack, but can't make them extinguish the walls of my base that are merrily burning away. I pick up penguins, manta rays, loch ness monsters and everything else and toss them at a burning wall, and the game just stupidly states ""No task to do, reverting to auto mode."" Gonna stop playing until they work this out. I know what I need the soggy sods to do, there is just currently no way to make them. I hop on one I have a saddle for and water blast my burning walls with no effect whatsoever, a pal has to DECIDE to put it out and only then is the fire like ""Ohhh, okay, I get it,"" and goes out.Trying to find where to go next is also a task. Pals go from level 1 to 5 to 43 with little rhyme or reason, and the world bosses levels make no sense at all for their areas.";Recommended;699;41.9;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Got the game when it was on sale. The attention to detail for the pals as well as the items is amazing. Love the fact that I can customize my character to look like me. Map is not too small nor too big. There is a good amount of variety within the pals you could potentially have. Liking the raider and dungeon features. Playing this game with my boyfriend has been really fun and entertaining. This game reminds me of Pokemon and Minecraft in one. Would recommend this game to others who are interested in a game like this.;Recommended;426;13.5;

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Product refundedI would recommend Palworld because it is a beautiful and immersive game that offers countless hours of exploration and creative potential.

""You only get to taste the forbidden fruit once"". Eve is a hoe... Means ur mom is a hoe.";Recommended;340;90.1;
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW;Honestly. Best ♥♥♥♥ i've played for years. I got so addicted to it I couldn't sleep properly for over a week! Punish & Enslave them all, make what you will with your pals let it be combat or enslavement, only you can choose their destiny.I love that, I can't wait for more DLC's, maps and Pals. I got 9k hrs in ark and this game is very similar to it's playstyle, just a tad bit crazier!;Recommended;312;121.6;
